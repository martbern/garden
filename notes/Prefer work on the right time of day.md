# Prefer work on the right time of day
Probably yeah. I feel more focused in the morning, so doing harder work here makes sense.

It also allows using the strength of habits ([[Habits make action easier]]).

But I don't know whether that's really true. Habits are TAP-like, in that they really are mostly determining of simple behaviours. 

Doing work is probably something you can make a habit; but the kind of work likely matters little.

Timing can matter somewhat; you have a much easier time doing creative writing in the morning than when you're tired. That's at th extreme, most of the time [[§Speed is more important than sequence for productivity]].

Q. Why might doing specific types of work in specific contexts be a disadvantage?
A. If the correct context or time of day is unavailable, it can conflict with what is most important right now.
