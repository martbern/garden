# §Learning
Learning means getting better at something. This means it contains a bunch of different concepts:

* [[Retention]]
* [[Critical thinking]]
* [[Comprehension]]
* [[Interpretation]]
* [[Distant transfer]]
* [[Classification]]
* [[Arithmatic]]

How, then, do we improve these? [[Learning techniques]]

More fuzzy encoding produces better "understanding", whatever that means: [[Wolfe, Reyna 2005]]
