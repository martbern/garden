	* Goal-setting works largely by [[Goal setting increases focus]]. This can backfire if you're in a novel or changing environment, since the newfound focus means that [[Goal setting decreases flexibility]]. Even worse, having only a long-term goal in a turbulent environment actually decreases performance (Latham 1999).
* [[On Goal Setting Theory]]
	* Goal-setting has a plethora of advantages, mainly that [[Goal setting increases performance]]. This happens immediately by [[Goal setting increases focus]] and [[Goal setting increases effort]]. It also increases the probability of goal-completion via two mechanims. (1) Proximal goals provide rapid feedback which can make you more skilled by [[Goals prompt strategy improvement]]. (2) Since goal-setting makes us more invested in goal-attainment, [[Goals increase persistence]]. Surprisingly, [[Goals can increase creativity]].
	* Goal setting can also backfire by resulting in other areas being neglected. The research shows that goal setting is essentially about directing focus ([[Goal setting increases focus]], [[Goal setting increases effort]]).
* [[Feedback guides focus]]
	* Probably via somewhat the same mechanisms as [[Goal setting increases focus]].
* [[Goals can increase creativity]]
	* Q. How might goals increase creativity?
* [[How might I align complice or similar with ACT]]
	* One of the worries with complice is that I set goals, and that since [[Goal setting increases focus]], it can also make me more likely to miss out on something important.
