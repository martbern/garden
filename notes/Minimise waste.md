# Minimise waste
[[Sources of waste in knowledge work]]

The sources of waste
* [[Work primarily on value adding activities]]
* [[Minimise non-value adding activities]]
	* [[Balance waiting]]
	* [[Minimise defects]]
	* [[Minimise overprocessing]]
	* [[Increase reusability]]
	
	* [[Minimise overproduction]]
	* [[Minimise inventory]]
	* [[Make use of skills]]
	* [[Minimise transportation]]
	* [[Minimise motion]]

There's a bunch of ways to do this:
* [[Optimise constraints]]
* [[Balance WIP]]
* [[Decrease lag time]]

* [[Validate research ideas]]
	* Ie. is there a higher level of abstraction we can work on, while not inducing too much overhead for co-authors? Given the sparcity of time I can get with all co-authors, they're most likely going to be bottlenecks. To [[Subordinate non-bottlenecks]], it makes sense for me to do more processing before showing it to them. This does collid with [[Minimise waste]], specifically [[Minimise overproduction]] and [[Minimise overprocessing]].

* [[Meta-skills for scientific productivity]]

* [[When is the ideal time to take a break]]
	* But I fear it isn’t very good for [[Minimise waste]], as I may be doing more breaks than necessary and I may be doing them exactly when I’m struggling with a hard problem. I want to [[Working well on problems determines scientific productivity]], so I can autonomously choose to continue working on something. In that sense, the pomodoro is not an ought to or should, but rather an indicator, a nudge.
