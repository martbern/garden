# A writing prompt stack 
An improvement to [[§Promote ideas by relevance]] might be to hash tag something when it is promoted, and then on the next promotion iteration, to move it down the promotion ladder and remove the hash tag.

This allows for an automatically changing stack of interesting writing prompts, which isn't terribly affected by then backlink updates.
