# Is there some ideal balance between input, processing and output
I get the sense that the amount of inputs (new ideas/reading/new data) is capped at some point, after which processing is required.

Further, I also feel more satisfied when there is some degree of output, a product of what I do.

I think Anki reviews may be inputs because they're stimulating my understanding of the world, prompting new connections but also that I need to think about them more to integrate into an understanding.
