# Feedback is most useful when it contains information
If the feedback is not changing how we believe the world looks, it can't help us get to where we want to go.

Say we already know where we want to go and how to get there. Then we don't need feedback (other than for motivational reasons).

Say we don't know where we want to go or how to get there. Then we need feedback that changes our perception of the world, either by illuminating what we don't know or correcting our mistakes. This means that the feedback needs to contain [[Information]].
