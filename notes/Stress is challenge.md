# Stress is challenge
And [[Challenge is intrinsically motivating]]. [[Difficulty can be both good and bad]].

If one approach doesn’t work, try something else. For example, I have noticed that, as long as distraction doesn’t become a habitual way of running away from emotions, it is an effective strategy in situations that are negative and upsetting. Reappraisal, on the other hand, is especially  [effective](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/0956797613496434?journalCode=pssa)  in situations that are uncontrollable, such as losing a job. It’s all about identifying your situation, the effect it’s having on you and your emotions, and then being creative about how to deal with it.
