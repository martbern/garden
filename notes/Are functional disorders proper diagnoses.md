# Are functional disorders proper diagnoses
Depends on [[§A proper diagnosis]].

[[Is BDS a proper diagnosis]]

## [[A proper diagnosis should be of benefit to the patient]]
I think the primary benefit of functional disorders is providing a temporary entity for research to revolve around.

Right now I don't think they provide external de-stigmatization, but they may provide it internally (ie. to the person themself).

They do provide some degree of societal benefits (CBT free of charge, AFAIK). Given that the bottleneck is capacity at the center for functional disorders, an interesting question becomes [[How do we scale up capacity for functional disorders]].

But I don't think they provide prognostic benefit for treatment ([[CBT works on anything]]), albeit somewhat for prognosis.

## [[A proper diagnosis should be valid]]
I'd imagine that the formal requirements, interrater-reliability and test-retest reliability, are decently satisfied. What irks me most is that lack of an idea of mechanism, [[§Proposed aetiologies of SSD]].
