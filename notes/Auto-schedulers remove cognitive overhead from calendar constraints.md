# Auto-schedulers remove cognitive overhead from calendar constraints
Sometimes you'll get activities that need to be done by a certain date, or can't be started yet.

Auto-schedulers makes this super easy. Input the restrictions and it'll take care of it.

The constraints no longer incur cognitive load; you don't have to remember it, nor take them into account when planning your day.
