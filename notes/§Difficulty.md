# §Difficulty
By difficulty I mean that something is challenging. 

For something to be difficult, a situation or challenge requires that  the person undertaking it expends more resources than they do at rest: focuses, mobilises resources, or thinks in new ways. 

It is often accompanied by a feeling of effort ([[§Effort]]) and, given the circumstances, can result in resistance to the task ([[§Resistance]]).

* [[Challenge is intrinsically motivating]]
	* [[We need challenge to enjoy life]]
	* [[Stress is challenge]]

* [[Difficulty can be both good and bad]]
	* [[Desirable difficulties]]

* [[§Determination]]
	* Determination is the act of choosing that something is important, and therefore persisting through difficulty ([[§Difficulty]]), in spite of effort ([[§Effort]]).
* [[Flow can make difficulty effortless]]
	* But difficulty ([[§Difficulty]]) becomes more salient as task difficulty increases. When difficulty arises, that task may already be at too high a difficulty for flow. Or it may not – my experience has been that if there are few distractions, good feedback (and the other criteria for flow).
