# Avoid cloze deletions
[[Anderson 1985]]'s dual-process model of memory distinguishes between free recall, cued recall and recognition.

Free recall outperforms the other two in how well they train memory. [[Glover 1989]].

It's a trade-off though; it probably increases difficulty during initial learning.
