For diagramming: [[Loopy]].

* [[Feedback loops can track either inputs or outputs]]
* [[Buffers delay action]]
	* [[Buffers stabilise]]
	* [[Buffees delay solutions to problems]]


* [[Systems should guide towards the desired state]]
	* [[Design systems that align emotions with cognitions]]
	* [[Do I want to make use of intermittent variable reward]]
		* [[Design systems that support valuing its actions]]
		* [[Design systems that support expectancy]]
		* [[Design systems that decrease impulsiveness]]
	* [[Design systems that value effortlessness]]

* [[System behavior is inherent to the system]]

* [[Mapping systems allow us to simulate responses to different inputs]]
* [[Mapping systems reveal non-intuitive points for intervention]]

Stability
* [[Systems have three states]]
* [[Systems with multiple paths to the same effect are more stable]]
* [[Proportional control stabilizes systems]]


Implementation
* [[Tools for feedback - to implement using systems thinking]]

## Backlinks
* [[Value effort efficiency]]
	* Systems, then, need to adapt to our changing circumstances and goals. This is possible via feedback ([[§Feedback]], [[§Systems Thinking]]]]).
