# §I: Nudge towards awareness of time for life decisions
One way of doing this is to visualise what my current project pipelines are going to look like in the grand scheme of things, eg. Life calendars: [Habits + Life Calendar By Weeks Of The Year - Google Sheets](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1_xR5aqMFNOGVqH4DnytqeiOs7laCX5VEFo0SsEK4U3U/edit#gid=14)

I can then have A/B/C in each cell, to visualise which projects are going on at that time. This isn’t great though.
