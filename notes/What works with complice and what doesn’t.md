# What works with complice and what doesn’t
Ie. how does it inform [[Design systems that align emotions with cognitions]]? #p1

The primary greatness of complice lies in the problem it solves: it aligns actions with goals while having short delay.

A bunch of notes on that:
* It encourages explicit goal statement
	* It keeps goals salient
	* It reaps some of the benefits from [[On Goal Setting Theory]]
* It encourages choice
* It has low delay from identifying a step to taking it ([[Delay decreases motivation]])
* It strongly links tasks to goals 
* It encourages reflection
* It minimises time spent organising

But some potential issues: 
* It doesn’t give informational feedback
	* You have to set your own finish line every day
	* It doesn’t visualise progress
	* It doesn’t give you perspective as to how much you can get done in a day
* It requires doing planning elsewhere
	* It doesn’t “close open loops”
* It encourages streaks/doesn't allow for archiving a project.
	* Although that can probably be remedied via archiving and a reminder
