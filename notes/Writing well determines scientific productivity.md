# Writing well determines scientific productivity
Having clear language, a style that convinces co-authors and reviewers.

You may want to write like Sia is going to be your reviewer; be critical.

Given that the actual act of writing is quite subjective (barring the arguments being poor, the language being shoddy or the grammar being incorrect), it doesn't have good feedback loops nor a way of ranking skill. This is why it's often given to the person with the least experience (ie. the person with the lowest comparative advantage).
