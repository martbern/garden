# You get what you measure
So measure only what matters. There is tension here; process goals typically don't measure what matters, they measure a necessary condition for the outcome. But process goals are the only ones with sufficiently tight feedback loops to be meaningful to measure ([[Feedback can increase performance]]).

This means that you want to measure as distant a performance measure as possible, as long as the feedback loop is sufficiently tight. What might that look like for knowledge work? 

This goes wrong for multiple reasons ([[Beware maximisation]], [[Avoid Goodhart's law]]).



How do we measure those while still trying to [[Avoid Goodhart's law]]? Probably by evaluating whether our measurements are getting us to where we want to go, as well as bounding the desired state. [[Positive feedback]] is dangerous – we want negative feedback when exceeding desired states in either direction.

This is probably useful for dedicating time to work! And for dedicating time to [[§Incremental thinking]]. In essence, you want "do enough" goals for beeminder.

This may be useful in my complice implementation.
