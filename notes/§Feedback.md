# §Feedback
Since [[Building requires feedback]], managing feedback is extremely high leverage. See also [[On providing feedback]]. 

* [[Measure the right things]]
	* [[You get what you measure]]
	* [[Beware maximisation]]
	* [[Feedback loops can track either inputs or outputs]]

How does it work?
	* [[Feedback guides focus]]
	* [[Systems have three states]]

Meta
* [[Interpret feedback correctly]]
* [[Get a mentor or coach to improve rapidly]]


* [[Go for efficient feedback]]

* [[Filter feedback]]
	* [[Get the right type of feedback]]
	* [[Set up the right feedback loops]]
	* [[Eliminate the wrong feedback loops]]

* [[Get high quality feedback]]
	* [[Get timely feedback]]
		* [[Fast positive but delayed negative feedback fosters compulsion]]
	* [[Get specific feedback]]
		* [[Feedback should be strategy oriented]]
	* [[Feedback is most useful when it contains information]]
		* [[Get exclusively high validity feedback]]
			* [[Filter feedback]]
	* [[Get feedback that supports BPN]]
	* [[High-quality feedback increases effort]]

## Backlinks
* [[Decrease lag time]]
	* Decreasing lag time means you get the benefits of finishing the project faster. This means faster feedback on whether the project was useful, which leads to faster improvement and fewer oscillations. [[§Feedback]].
* [[§Working in Public]]
	* It means that I will get feedback, and you need feedback to improve ([[§Feedback]]).
* [[§Executing well]]
	* [[§Feedback]]
* [[Meta-skills for scientific productivity]]
	* [[§Feedback]]
* [[Systems should guide towards the desired state]]
	* This means that systems should provide the right feedback ([[§Feedback]]), and probably give negative feedback at both the upper and lower bound.
* [[High quality feedback increases effort]]
	* [[§Feedback]]. 
* [[Value effort efficiency]]
	* Systems, then, need to adapt to our changing circumstances and goals. This is possible via feedback ([[§Feedback]], [[§Systems Thinking]]]]).
* [[§Systems Thinking]]
	* See also [[§Feedback]]. 
* [[Emotions shape behaviour]]
	* But it does imply that paying attention to, and designing around our emotions during a behaviour is beneficial in shaping our future behaviours. In that sense, emotions are [[§Feedback]], allowing some parts of our brain to communicate with other parts. 
* [[How would I know if I were wrong?]]
	* An important prompt for [[§Feedback]].
