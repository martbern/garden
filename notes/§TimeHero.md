# §TimeHero
Helps solve:
* [[Balance daily bandwidth]]
* [[Balance weekly bandwidth]]
* [[Informational feedback for daily work]]

But it does poorly at:
* [[Intention as context]]
* [[Most important work first]]

For TimeHero, I'm motivated since [[Informational process goals are motivating]]. When I assign an expected amount of time to a task, 

Especially for intra-day tasks, [[§Speed is more important than sequence for productivity]], except for highly creative tasks – but I can still promote those by adding an importance flag in TimeHero.

## Backlinks
* [[§My execution system]]
	* Right now it's a combination of [[Complice.co]], [[Sunsama]] and [[§TimeHero]].
* [[§Auto-schedulers]]
	* Examples of auto-schedulers (for back-linking): [[SkedPal]], [[§TimeHero]]
* [[§Taskheat]]
	* But it doesn’t give me much informational feedback on how much progress I’ve made today; it doesn’t give me a goal-post to aim for like [[§TimeHero]] does.
