# Imagine You're 80 Years Old
So I’m going to ask you to imagine your eightieth birthday and to imagine that three different people stand up to make speeches about you. And keep in mind, this is a fantasy—an imaginary exercise—so it doesn’t have to follow the rules of logic and science. You can be eighty, but your friends may look exactly as they do today. And you can have people there who are already dead, or who’ll be dead by the time you’re eighty. And if you want to have children one day, then you can have your children there. Also keep in mind, you aren’t trying to realistically predict the future. You’re creating a fantasy—if magic could happen so that all your dreams come true—then what would your eightieth birthday look like? So if your mind starts interfering and saying things like, People don’t mean what they say at these events or No, that person would never say that about me, then just say “Thanks, mind” and come back to the exercise. Okay?

Okay. So I invite you to get into a comfortable position, and either close your eyes or fix them on a spot … and for the next few breaths, focus on emptying your lungs … pushing all the air out … and allowing them to fill by themselves … Notice the breath flowing in and flowing out … in through the nostrils … down into the lungs …. and back out … Notice how, once the lungs are empty, they automatically refill … And now, allowing your breath to find its own natural rate and rhythm … no need to keep controlling it … I’d like you to do an exercise in imagination … to create a fantasy of your ideal eightieth birthday … not to try and realistically predict it but to fantasize how it would be in the ideal world, if magic could happen and all your dreams came true … So it’s your eightieth birthday, and everyone who truly matters to you … friends, family, partner, parents, children, colleagues … anyone and everyone whom you truly care about, even if they’re no longer alive, is gathered there in your honor … This might be a small intimate affair in a family home or a huge affair in a classy restaurant … it’s your imagination, so create it the way you want it … Now imagine that one person whom you really care about—friend, child, partner, parent, you choose—stands up to make a speech about you … a short speech, no more than three or four sentences … and they talk about what you stand for in life … what you mean to them … and the role that you have played in their life … and imagine them saying whatever it is deep in your heart you would most love to hear them say.

(One person at a time, 2-3 people)

Most people find that this exercise brings up a whole range of feelings, some warm and loving, and some very painful. So take a moment to notice what you’re feeling … and consider what these feelings tell you … about what truly matters to you … what sort of person you want to be … and what if, anything, you’re currently neglecting. (Pause 30 seconds.) And now, bringing the exercise to an end … and notice your breathing … and notice your body in the chair … and notice the sounds you can hear … and open your eyes and notice what you can see … and take a stretch … and notice yourself stretching … and welcome back!

Afterward we debrief the exercise in detail: What happened? What did people say about you? What does this tell you about what matters to you, what you want to stand for, and what sort of person you want to be?

We can also inquire about fusion and avoidance: How did your mind try to interfere with the exercise? Did you get hooked at any point? How did you unhook yourself? What feelings showed up for you? Did you make room for them or struggle? Did you avoid doing the exercise?
