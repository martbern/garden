# Balance context switching
You should minimise context-switching at the minute to an hour level, but have moderate switching at the hour+ level. This allows you to work on novel, interesting things (increasing performance) while avoiding most of the waste of context switching:

> The moral is that you should try to stay on a single task as long as possible without decreasing your responsiveness below the minimum acceptable limit.

[[Even though context-switching decreases efficiency, it most likely increases effectiveness by increasing total output]]

Another way of phrasing it is to do "slow motion multitasking".

One of the reasons is [[Task switching leaves attention residue]]

Q. Why might we want to decrease context switching at the scale of minutes?
A. [[Task switching leaves attention residue]]

Q. Why might context-switching be beneficial at the timescale of hours? 
A. It keeps things interesting

	* Inboxes make it difficult to [[Balance context switching]], since they tend to make you browse more information than what you need.
	* Q. Why might we want to decrease use of inboxes?
* [[Minimising WIP increases efficiency]]
	* When we minimise WIP, we make it easier for individuals to stay focused. We have less on our minds that can provide internal context switching, and we have fewer people vying for our attention, decreasing external context switching. This helps [[Balance context switching]]. Having less on our minds also makes it much easier to prioritise, decreasing overhead.
* [[Keep planning and execution separated]]
	* This helps [[Balance context switching]] as well as to keep duration estimates independent from current psychological state, maintaining [[Informational process goals are motivating]].
* [[Taskheat vs TimeHero]]
	* Really all I can import into TimeHero is the name, duration, start and due date and assignee. This creates tons of problems for a potential import; if I update all tasks, I’ll have to update dependencies all the time. If I update only the actionable tasks, I’ll switch between paths all the time, running into problems with [[Balance context switching]].
* [[How might I set up my computer for slow motion multitasking]]
	* Eg. to [[Balance context switching]]. One way is to have a specific account for consumption, eg. Twitter/Facebook/Email.
