# The academic process can't be subjected to bottleneck analysis
Bottlenecks are rarely multiplicative – they limit production until a certain point, at which time they cease to matter at all. It's typically linear, then sudden plateau. This doesn't fit this model that well, so drum-buffer-rope etc. probably doesn't work.

However, the idea of focusing on the weakest link is a good idea, given the multiplicative nature of the model – assuming that improving is typically additive to the factor, not further multiplicative. Otherwise, it doesn't matter  which factor you improve at, but that seems unlikely! The "learning curve" for each skill is probably something akin to:
