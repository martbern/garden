# Choosing is everything
[[Generating options increases agency]].

The feeling of choice is absolutely exhilarating, and fundamental to a life well-lived. It is the basis of everything we do; choosing is when we are alive.

Eg. 
* Bad or no choices will make anyone’s life miserable ([[Lack of self-direction is defeating]])
* Given who you are, where you live and the privilege you have, your choices matter far more than circumstance.

How, then, do we facilitate it? We want cognitive choices and emotional alignment ([[Align emotions and cognitions]]). 

* Both
	* Mindful reflection
	* Periodically setting goals are the best systems I’ve found so far

Another is to frame our actions as chosen; not to ignore the factors that shape our choices, but to accept the responsibility and possibility that comes with free will. This is not going to be a philosophical argument as to whether it is there or not. Rather, it’s based on the pragmatic observation that believing it to be so is beneficial, and not choosing is depressing.

> Fear is a reaction. Courage is a decision.

	* [[Choosing is everything]]. If we don’t make choices and affect change in the world, we’re going to be disappointed in our lives – no matter how they turn out.
* [[Use automaticity in the right places]]
	* Since [[Choosing is everything]], we want to use automaticity only in the right places, and to prompt choice in the others
