# How do I balance think-research-read-do-experience
This ties into [[§Problem solving]] – most of what I do in my life is about solving problems, and then we have a small subset that is just about experiences.

The question itself needs to be better defined. There's something about order, how do I balance what to do when. [[Order activities]].

There's also a throughput dimensions, how do we best balance how much to do of each?
[[How do I prioritise bandwidth for activity types?]]

Much of this can, in general, be prioritised ad-hoc ([[Use heuristics for prioritisation]]) – but that requires that I'm continuously exposed to my ideas, without being overwhelmed by them.
