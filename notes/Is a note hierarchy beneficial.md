# Is a note hierarchy beneficial?
Adding a hierarchy adds more steps; but which problems does it solve?

It can help separate useful from inbox-type notes ( [[Don’t dilute evergreen notes]]), but that is rarely a problem I run into .

It can also help amplify [[Building requires repeated effort]], but I think my curation/promotion system does that rather effectively already.
