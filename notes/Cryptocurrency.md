# Cryptocurrency
Starting balance, ~600 DKK BTC, 150 DKK ZCoin

## Technicals
On Mac, my wallet is Electrum.

For zCoins, Jaxx.

Seed is placed in "important documents" folder (with passport etc.)

## Purpose
To hedge my bets in case the economy turns completely decentralized.

## Outcome visioning
Bitcoin or ethereum takes over the world economy – I invested relatively early, so I have enough money to buy a house or something comparable, ensuring the in this decentralized economy I'll be able to support myself and those close to me.

## Ejector seats
I will liquidate my positions in these cases, and these cases only:

1. My investment is worth the buying power of 2.000.000 DKK from 2018.
2. My economic situation is such that liquidating my investment will help me as much as getting a new apartment.
3. My investment's inflation-adjusted peak and valley values from the last 5 years are ± 10% of the current value – ie. value stabilisation.

In the case of liquidation, I will either buy something tangible, like a residence, or diversify into more investments.

The above may be changed 'till the end of 2018.
