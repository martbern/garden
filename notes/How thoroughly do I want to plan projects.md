# How thoroughly do I want to plan projects
Depends on how certain you are you want to complete the projects. Since [[JIT decreases overproduction]], and most project ideas you come up with you don't complete, you want to plan projects just in time.

However, you also don't want to run out of work or overlook important dependencies.

For most work you're doing, [[§Speed is more important than sequence for productivity]], but there are some important caveats there.
