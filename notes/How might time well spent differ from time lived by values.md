# How might time well spent differ from time lived by values
And what implications might that have for [[§My Implementation of Life Well Spent (LWS)]]?

In some sense "time well spent" captures all the aspects; what to do and how to do it. But I might want slightly more focus on the "how":
	* Why did I do that? 
	* Did I do it well? 
	* How can I do it better?

If an activity consistently gets low ratings, it indicates that either the activity is poor or the way I'm executing it is poor. I can use notes to separate those two.
