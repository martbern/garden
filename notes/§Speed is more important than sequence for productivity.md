# §Speed is more important than sequence for productivity
For most tasks that I complete, completing it quickly and without too much fuss is often more important than sequence.

This has some interesting consequences; it's rarely justified to spend much time and/or energy considering exactly which task to do now. Rather, it's more important to go by gut feel, to improve perceived autonomy.

This means that I can take advantage of [[Rough scheduling increases perceived autonomy]] and [[Auto-scheduling limits analysis paralysis]].

Exceptions to the rule are:
[[Sequence matters when there are task dependencies]],
[[Sequence matters when I am not the bottleneck]],
[[Sequence matters when context-switching costs are high]],
[[Sequence matters when a task drains a resource on a temporary basis]]

## Backlinks
* [[How thoroughly do I want to plan projects]]
	* For most work you're doing, [[§Speed is more important than sequence for productivity]], but there are some important caveats there.
* [[§General principles for optional activities]]
	* It is not essential that we make *the best* decision, but we want to make systems that encourage easily making good decisions quickly ([[Use heuristics for prioritisation]], [[§Speed is more important than sequence for productivity]]). Intuition + salient options seems a good choice here.
* [[§TimeHero]]
	* Especially for intra-day tasks, [[§Speed is more important than sequence for productivity]], except for highly creative tasks – but I can still promote those by adding an importance flag in TimeHero.
* [[Prefer work on the right time of day]]
	* Timing can matter somewhat; you have a much easier time doing creative writing in the morning than when you're tired. That's at th extreme, most of the time [[§Speed is more important than sequence for productivity]].
* [[§Auto-schedulers]]
	* [[Auto-scheduling limits analysis paralysis]], almost entirely eliminating it if you're relying on a specific schedule. But that's mostly because I haven't yet internalized that [[§Speed is more important than sequence for productivity]].
	* The decrease in options comes from considering hard deadlines, one of the exceptions to [[§Speed is more important than sequence for productivity]].
* [[How does SkedPal vs. TimeHero affect my emotional response to completing tasks]]
	* While SkedPal allows me to be more specific about the order of tasks, that's both a blessing and a curse. It means I need to spend more time managing them, and less time actually getting work done. It also dramatically increases the complexity for the engine, leading to slower re-schedules. Especially for intra-day tasks, [[§Speed is more important than sequence for productivity]], except for highly creative tasks – but I can still promote those by adding an importance flag in TimeHero.
* [[Do you want to use an auto-scheduler for work]]
	* Most of the arguments in [[§Auto-schedulers]] apply to this question as well, especially given that work is affected by many of the exceptions to [[§Speed is more important than sequence for productivity]], eg.
