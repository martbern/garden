It's important to [[Design your physical environment]], so that it helps you [[Take action on your values to live a meaningful life]]. Whether that be an apartment or a house.

This means that it needs to support:
1. Sleep
	1. Automate lighting?
		1. Samsung smart lighting?
		2. IKEA blinds
			1. Cut slats so that it can fit tightly to the edges
2. Social gathering
	1. Dinner parties
		1. Get a large (extendable) table
		2. Dishwasher
		3. Enough dishes and cutlery for 8
	2. Intellectual conversations
	3. Board game nights
	4. Computer-gaming nights
3. Living deeply
	1. Thinking through things
	2. Reading deeply

And to discourage some of my worse habits, specifically:
1. Watching TV alone
	1. Wall-mount TV in the corner
	2. Don't have any subscription services
	3. Do have a chromecast, if friends want to put something on
2. Gaming alone
	1. [[Put the gaming computer in a cupboard]]
3. Getting lost on browsing
