I have a couple of ideas for this:
* [[Was today enough]]
* [[Measure distractions]]
* [[Measure story points]]

One open problem is that some of my activities don’t fit neatly into an execution perspective. They’re open-ended, about structuring how to get somewhere or figuring out where it is possible to go. Eg. structuring my PhD search. 

Putting outcome pressure on that is likely something akin to putting pressure on a creative process, likely to backfire.

This likely depends on the type of activity. If it’s structuring a problem, giving it a story-point style gauge isn’t too bad. If it’s about creatively solving a problem, giving it a minimum amount of time may not be too bad either – especially given the

On the other hand, I get the sense that knowing how long I spent on exploration is helpful. It isn’t required for determining whether that exploration was really needed (that depends on whether there was a promising direction when I started the exploration). And it isn’t required for determining the next approach (that depends on what type of issue I’m facing).

[[§Guide exploration]]

One way of getting around that may be to do it like Andy Matuschak; on a daily level, plan activities, then deontologically fixate on getting that plan done. On a weekly, monthly or yearly level, evaluate whether your activities lead to helpful outcomes. Those longer-term goals support error-correction by providing feedback – but you don’t want that feedback when you’re in the weeds, because [[Creativity flourishes in safety]].
