# Test quickly for writing
I’m trying to:
* Avoid subjective ambiguity early in the research phase
* Decrease time writing and re-writing ([[Minimise overprocessing]]) 

Why does this happen? Because we don’t have a way of communicating our ideas clearly without almost producing the finished product. That’s a shame! How might that look?

[[Prototyping for research ideas]]

## Backlinks
* [[Outline well]]
	* [[Test quickly for writing]]
* [[Stay flexible when ideating]]
	* How would this look for scientific research? ([[Quality check at low value]], [[Test quickly for writing]])
