# Keeping media salient without inboxes
[[Implementation of Keeping media salient without inboxes]]

The general idea is to avoid [[Inboxes feel like obligations]], but also spending too much time collecting media ([[Collecting material feels more useful than it typically is]]) and/or browsing media that has high novelty but makes little difference in your life ([[Artificial novelty distracts from true exploration]]).

Classic inbox-like implementations (Pocket/Instapaper) are 100% based on recency, limiting [[Randomness promotes serendipity]]. Furthermore, this ordering based on recency or other factors suggests that there is an order to be followed, making it feel somewhat like an inbox.

Since we're continually adding more articles, past articles will take up a gradually larger portion of the suggested articles. This isn't necessarily a problem; it biases towards "exploitation" of known information rather than exploration of new information, which makes sense since my reading interval is decreasing (for more, see [[Explore or Exploit problem]]). However, we may counteract some of the effect by showing recently added articles more often ([[Bias towards recency]]).

Ideally, I'd be able to browse the periodical suggestions as well, when I remember "something about XY". This can be achieved by forwarding them to a separate email that is added to a separate email client.

I want to [[Decrease options to make decision-making easier]] by presenting the options in sets.

If you're pushing towards exploit rather than explore, you want to decrease delay between browsing and reading as much as possible ([[Delay decreases motivation]]). This makes you more likely to read and think, and avoids [[Collecting material feels more useful than it typically is]].

Whether I want a mobile option depends on what I think the consequences of that are going to be – currently, I fear that it may detract from day-to-day interaction by making a more interesting option available at all times ([[Burn the ships to strengthen your resolve]]).

It is essential with easy ingest for a book/media management system. When getting distracted on the internet, it allows you to easily let go of the path and return to it in the future, hence [[Make it easy to ingest]].
