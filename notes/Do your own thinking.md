# Do your own thinking
[[Gears-level understanding allows changing the world]]. This means that having information is not at all enough, we need to know how that information relates to the world around us. This requires that we do our own thinking – that we don't just consume information, we figure out where and how it applies ([[Knowledge work is like building a graph]]). However, for problems that are well defined and already solved, it’s a good idea to seek help ([[Balance searching for and making your own solutions]]).

It's also incredibly rewarding! Like [[Knowledge has intrinsic meaning]], [[Understanding has intrinsic meaning]]. It's allowing our [[§Intrinsic motivation]] to flourish! Or, for learning that’s at least partially in the extrinsic category, it helps integrate the motivation.

Right now, I think this is my primary bottleneck in learning and improving my life. I want to consider how to optimise for this bottleneck:
[[Consider turning off internet on first wake, to encourage contemplation]]

* [[Establish a causal model]]
	* It is almost always a good idea to first [[Do your own thinking]], and if afterwards it is indicated, to research what others believe ([[Balance researching and thinking for causal models]], [[Collaboration speeds up problem solving]]).
* [[The personal mnemonic medium programs attention]]
	* The [[§The Personal Mnemonic Medium (general concept)]]  is a great way of implementing that. It allows you to [[Do your own thinking]], and when you reach tentative conclusions, to easily entrain those into action ([[Action makes knowledge useful]]).
* [[I want ideation to be fun]]
	* My ideation is, to a large extent, driven by intrinsic motivation. I want to [[Do your own thinking]], because [[Understanding has intrinsic meaning]] and it's just plain fun! [[Fun is the spice of life]].
