# How do we best adjust for somatic and psychiatric diagnoses
We worry that we don't capture enough of the variance but dichotomizing psychiatric disease. One option, which we can explore in the second article, is to have categories of diseases - eg. depression, adhd, skizophrenia etc.

A sensitivity analysis could be to exclude all contacts after any new diagnosis.

*When do we want to adjust for incident diagnoses?*
If we're looking to close the path from diagnosis to our outcome, ie. to isolate the effect that MHC captures from the effect captured by the diagnoses themselves.

* [[How do we adjust for incident diagnoses]]

If we're looking at hospital contacts as an outcome, we only want to adjust for the incident diagnoses that are not our outcome. Examples may be:
* R-diagnoses, which are symptoms and signs! We have to exclude the signs, though.
* Z-diagnoses
