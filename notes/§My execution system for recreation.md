[[§Spaced doing]]

Right now, the major problem is that I have TimeHero growing stale, but no good system to replace it. How do I make such a system, and relatively rapidly?

One way is to use Airtable for tasks, and then suggest those tasks in a spaced-repetition manner. Then, during daily planning, I can choose which tasks I think would be nice to get done.

For maintenance tasks, add a specific interval, and show the task when that interval has run its course. Also add an elasticity factor (essentially a probability that the task will be shown) to avoid all tasks being shown all the time, and to allow "defer" actions to increase the interval. If elasticity is 0, defer doesn't increase the tasks interval.

For misc. one-timers, just have them there and set a schedule. After N skips, archive the task.

For calendar events, I don't have a good routine right now. Maybe I can receive a daily email or something? Or I can use Integromat to get all events for today, and then mail them to me. But that can maybe only be done at a calendar level, rather than a google account level. Unsure.
