# Work on the right problems
This means that we need to [[Discover interesting problems]], [[Select the right problems]] and [[Stick with the right problems]].

## Backlinks
* [[§Scientific Productivity]]
	* [[Work on the right problems]], implemented via [[Shape research ideas]]
* [[§Make time for exploration]]
	* Exploratory actions are often open-ended and interest-driven, without obvious output. But they're still incredibly important. We can't conceive of the novel study unless we know the relevant questions ([[Work on the right problems]]), and we can't answer those questions unless we know the right methods ([[Use the right methods]]).
* [[Writing papers effectively determines scientific productivity]]
	* This assumes that you have the ideas somewhat well-defined before you start the writing of the paper, see [[Work on the right problems]] and [[Working well on problems determines scientific productivity]].
* [[Ability to attract funding determines scientific productivity]]
	* Interacts with [[Work on the right problems]]. If you can't get funded, you can't be productive.
