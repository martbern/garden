# §Problem solving
A strong model is something like:
1. [[Define the problem]]
2. [[Shape the strategy]]
3. [[Probe the approach]]
4. [[Do the work]]
5. [[Learn from outcomes]]

Often, ideas are what become psychologically salient. But doing the above is likely to be tremendously useful!

Q. If you had to split problem-solving into 5 stages, what might those be?
A. [[Define the problem]], [[Shape the strategy]], [[Probe the approach]], [[Do the work]], [[Learn from outcomes]]

	* I fear that I have a tendency to make processes clearer and more explicit (eg. [[§Problem solving]] and [[§My research system]], without keeping in mind whether this clarification actually improves the process.
