# §Self-recommendations
One of the solutions to [[Inboxes feel like obligations]], based on the [[§General principles for optional activities]].

[[Motivation is increased by salience]], so we need to keep options salient. But [[Inboxes feel like obligations]], so we don't present a list. Rather, we send an email with a recency-weighted pseudorandom sample periodically – an email "newsletter" based on recommendations from your past self.

[[§Guide exploration]].

Why these recommendations rather than finding something on the net? [[De-prioritise shallow novelty]].

Why recency-weighted? [[Practical reasons should guide exploration]], and practical reasons likely help you prioritise your exploration.

Currently I have it implemented for media, but I want to implement it for basically all optional but important tasks. This means [[§My research system]] and [[§My optional execution system]].

## Backlinks
* [[Extract tags with context from notes to Airtable]]
	* This is an extension of [[§My note system]], allowing weighted random prompts to be sent to me via some system. It's a general implementation of the [[§Self-recommendations]], but now not only for things to read, but for actions more broadly.
* [[§General principles for optional activities]]
	* One implementation of this is the [[§Self-recommendations]].
* [[Order activities]]
	* My best implementation of this so far is the [[§Self-recommendations]].
