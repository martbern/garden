# How much time is optimal for exploration
The more novelty, curiosity and creativity are important to you, the more time you want to dedicate to exploration.

The more your field rewards novelty and creativity, the more time dedicated to exploration will pay off.

The tighter your deadlines, the costlier exploration will be.

Honestly, there are no one-size-fits-all solutions, only guidelines that can help you think about what is right in your situation. [[Building requires feedback]], and the feedback loop on exploration is unfortunately often quite long.
