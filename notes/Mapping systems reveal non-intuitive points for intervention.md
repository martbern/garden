# Mapping systems reveal non-intuitive points for intervention
Especially in systems with feedback loops. One easy, light-weight way of mapping them is [[Loopy]], alternatively the procedure from [[Evaporating Cloud]].

This can be both in the form of feedback loops to break, feedback points to replace or possibilities for adding new feedback loops.

[[When does it make sense to map systems?]]

---

Q. Why might we want to draw a map of how a system works?
A. To 1) simulate responses to a range of inputs and 2) find non-intuitive spots for intervention

Q. You're performing a behaviour, but you don't understand why. Which thinking tools might help?
A. Draw the feedback loops. Others?

Q. You disagree strongly with someone about which actions to take. Which thinking tool might help?
A. [[Evaporating Cloud]]

Q. Recall a time you disagreed strongly with someone about which actions to take. Which thinking tool might’ve helped?
A. [[Evaporating Cloud]]

Q. Recall a behaviour that puzzles you. Might diagramming it with [[Loopy]] help?
A. .
