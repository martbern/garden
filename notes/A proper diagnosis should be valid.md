# A proper diagnosis should be valid
A proper diagnosis should also be valid. This means that it should have:
* [[A proper diagnosis has high interrater-reliability]]
* [[A proper diagnosis has test-retest reliability that matches the proposed mechanism]]
* [[A proper diagnosis is incrementally valid]]

And can be supported by:
 * [[A proper diagnosis is supported by a proposed mechanism]], ideally experimentally validated.

<!-- #work/learn Which other factors from psychometrics might make a diagnosis valid? Does it make sense to add flashcards from those? -->
