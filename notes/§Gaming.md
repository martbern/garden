# §Gaming
I want to maintain gaming because [[Gaming can allow shared experiences]]; they are a good reason for me to keep seeing Simon and Mads, two people I care tremendously about. They're also just plain fun! ([[§Gaming upsides]]). 

But, there are cases and circumstances where gaming can tremendously worsen my life. [[Some games foster compulsion]], in the sense that they are habit-forming above and beyond what is beneficial to the user ([[§Gaming downsides]]).

The implication, then, is about [[Can I build a healthy relationship with gaming?]]. And furthermore, how?

So far, the best solution has been to make alternatives easy to get started on, see [[§My Implementation of Life Well Spent (LWS)]].
