# §Guide exploration
> If you haven’t generated many new ideas /despite/ putting in the time, try shaking up your methods. If that doesn’t work, you may have reached a cul-de-sac, so try backtracking.

> From time to time, I flip back into execution mode. It feels like an old friend. We say hello, dance for a while, and part ways smiling, just as it always was.
> Open-ended mode is more enigmatic, reserved—yet occasionally it sparks some moment so singular it lights up the whole year. Those moments don’t happen without the days spent together /between/ those moments. I’m slowly learning to make the most of our quiet strolls.

When exploring, you want to increase the [[§Deep Novelty]]-to-noise ratio. This can be done in many ways, some thoughts: [[Strategies for increasing novelty-to-noise ratio]].

Q. What are advantages of guiding exploration?
A. It removes noisy sources, and it allows for specialisation – making it exploration for society, rather than just exploration for you.

Guide exploration:

* [[Exploration is more efficient with memory]]
* [[Guiding exploration is necessary due to infinite paths]]

General principles:

* [[Exploration is about learning]]
* [[Exploration is searching for novelty]]

Actionable advice:

* [[Balance exploration and specialisation]]
  * [[De-prioritise shallow novelty]]
  * [[Remember what you've explored]]
* [[Practical reasons should guide exploration]]
