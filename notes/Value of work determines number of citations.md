# Value of work determines number of citations
I want to make scientific work of high quality. Quality means work that is impactful in the sense of changing our models of the world, especially if that change uncovers levers for changing the world.

[[Valuable research changes our model of the world]] and [[Valuable research uncovers levers for change]].

Since the distribution of citations is log-normal, ie. that highly valuable works get /highly/ cited, citations appropriately reward quality, albeit at a slower pace.

There are some issues. Smaller fields are likely to have a lag-time of citations on important work: the field has to grow before the papers get cited. However, foundational papers are likely to massively pay off in the long run.

Review and meta-analysis papers are over-compensated, since they cover a lot of ground.

If you optimise for number of citations over the very long run, you're most likely optimising for scientific productivity as well :-)
