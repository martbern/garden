# Minimise overprocessing
Overprocessing is making something better than it needs to be; adding more components, making those components more efficient or more detailed, running more analyses than needed etc.

The best counter to this is to have a clear goal or use-case in mind. You can then hold decisions up against that use-case.d

	* Ie. is there a higher level of abstraction we can work on, while not inducing too much overhead for co-authors? Given the sparcity of time I can get with all co-authors, they're most likely going to be bottlenecks. To [[Subordinate non-bottlenecks]], it makes sense for me to do more processing before showing it to them. This does collid with [[Minimise waste]], specifically [[Minimise overproduction]] and [[Minimise overprocessing]].
