# Adjacent possible
> Both evolution and innovation tend to happen within the bounds of the adjacent possible, in other words the realm of possibilities available at any given moment.

One of the reasons that we might do [[Novelty search]].

The predominance of multiples in innovation highlights how the adjacent possible is constrained by existing parts and knowledge. A multiple occurs when several people independently make the same discovery almost simultaneously.

This is an argument for learning for fun, eg. following [[§Intrinsic motivation]]. Unfortunately, it's not an argument for the humanities – for something to be novelty search, it still needs to provide valid information about reality. Much of the humanities is inherently biased, or doesn't relate much to reality.

* [[Has epidemiology ever contributed to novelty search]]
	* The question is more open re: topics where causal models are likely more complicated – eg. whether it has expanded the [[Adjacent possible]], especially in areas where we don’t have strong causal hypotheses.
