# CBT works on anything
See Roam for empirical evidence for this claim.

Since CBT affects our perception of the world, which is typically what is measured in medical studies, it'll work as a treatment for any condition.

Evidence for this:
* https://www.cochranelibrary.com/cdsr/doi/10.1002/14651858.CD011818.pub2/full

CBT works for asthma control, (SMD ‐0.98, 95% CI ‐1.76 to ‐0.20; participants = 95; studies = 3; I2 = 68%)

* https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31891145/

A corollary: [[Whether CBT is an effective treatment tells us very little about the aetiology of the condition]]

## Backlinks
* [[Are functional disorders proper diagnoses]]
	* But I don't think they provide prognostic benefit for treatment ([[CBT works on anything]]), albeit somewhat for prognosis.
* [[Functional somatic syndromes share patient response]]
	* Isn't this due to [[CBT works on anything]]? Ie. that most of the interventions improve well-being, which improves symptom reporting across almost all syndromes, including with organic pathology?
