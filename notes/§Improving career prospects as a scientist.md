# §Improving career prospects as a scientist
To increase career prospects, increase signalling value. Signalling value is increased by either providing more value, or showing off that value more prominently.

In the below, I've added the "terminal" nodes, ie. where each point generates value. Like in a processing plant, this is each step where a product that is being "sold" is generated – it doesn't include value in the BNP sense.

#### Provide value to the institution
1. [[Ability to attract funding determines scientific employment]]
2. [[Relative number of citations determine scientific employment]]
3. [[Relationships determine scientific employment]]
4. [[International collaboration determines scientific employment]]
5. [[Do PR work]]
