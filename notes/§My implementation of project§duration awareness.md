# §My implementation of project-duration awareness
The question I'm asking is, primarily, "how large a proportion of the project is left". This feeds my intuition for how much I can still get done.

A better way, though, is probably two-layer donut charts. This allows for easier estimation of rough proportions, as well as more granular detail.

It’s is somewhat about how close I am to comletion (albeit somewhat of a guess), but it’s about capping my downside – about whether it's wise to make further bets at this time.

What's missing for implementation to be succesful is
