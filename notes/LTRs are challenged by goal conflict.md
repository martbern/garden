# LTRs are challenged by goal conflict
If you disagree strongly, and you agree that [[LTRs thrive with goal overlap]], you want to explore whether the goal is essential for living by your values ([[Live by values, not by rules]]).

This goes especially if you have sufficient time (ie. you're young) and you think that you can build a partnership that is as good as the one you have right now.

	* For young people, the decision has to be made under large uncertainty. You don't want the children /right now/, but you do want to be in a relationship that you think will fulfill your values. This means that [[LTRs are challenged by goal conflict]], and that you want to explore whether having children is necessary to live by your values. If not, that may be a solution to the problem.
