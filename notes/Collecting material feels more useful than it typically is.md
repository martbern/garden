# Collecting material feels more useful than it typically is
Collecting media is essential to choose good media, but the act of conscious prioritisation is computationally very hard ([[Use heuristics for prioritisation]]).

As such, using intuition and/or exporting it to ML ([[Refind]]) is so far my best solutions.

After all, we should use our energy in connecting materials, since [[Novel connections are hugely creative]].

## Backlinks
* [[Keeping media salient without inboxes]]
	* The general idea is to avoid [[Inboxes feel like obligations]], but also spending too much time collecting media ([[Collecting material feels more useful than it typically is]]) and/or browsing media that has high novelty but makes little difference in your life ([[Artificial novelty distracts from true exploration]]).
	* If you're pushing towards exploit rather than explore, you want to decrease delay between browsing and reading as much as possible ([[Delay decreases motivation]]). This makes you more likely to read and think, and avoids [[Collecting material feels more useful than it typically is]].
* [[Programmable attention]]
	* Beware that [[Collecting material feels more useful than it typically is]], so you want the ideal system to bias towards consuming and contemplating the media, but without making it feel forced.
* [[How do I best handle the continuing stream of inklings]]
	* But ideas are constantly generated in a never-ending stream, so saving all and leaving none is not a viable solution. My primary issue is not enough time spent thinking, and I want to protect that time ([[Building requires repeated effort]]). [[Retention is not valuable for its own sake]] and [[Collecting material feels more useful than it typically is]], and this goes for new ideas as well.
