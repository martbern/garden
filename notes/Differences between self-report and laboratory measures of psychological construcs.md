# Differences between self-report and laboratory measures of psychological construcs
* Behavioral measures tap uncommon stimuli in structured environments
* Behavioral measures are objective, subjective are based on perception of performance rather than performance itself
* Behavioral measures tend to tap maximal performance, rather than the typical performance of subjective measures

This is similar to the competence-performance gap – competence is ability, performance is ability + motivation + effort + willingness.
