# MIP helps make the world a better place
This means that it is EA-aligned or adjacent. We can make the world a better place in three ways:

* Implement something that makes the world better
* Research that allows us to make better decisions (ie. high VoI)
* Explore which decisions can even be made (novelty search)

While novelty search is required if we’re looking to be innovative, it is not what the current research climate is focused on. It is also super hard to do utility estimates on, since we don't know exactly what we're looking for. We can't even do [[Value of Information (VoI)]] calculations.

One open question on that is, [[Has epidemiology ever contributed to novelty search]]?

Rather, the research environment looks for projects that are likely to resolve a core uncertainty that allows us to make better decisions.

For cause areas, it is helpful for something, and doesn’t likely worsen:
* Climate change
* The economy of developing countries
