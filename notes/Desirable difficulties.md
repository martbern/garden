# Desirable difficulties
Increasing the difficulty of a training activity can often increase it's effectiveness. This gives rise to a bunch of counter-intuitive situations.

[[Bjork 1994]] cites a list of desirable difficulties:

* Shuffling heterogenous tasks rather than grouping repetitions by task type
* Varying the parameters of a task
* Varying the environmental context of learning sessions
* Creating “contextual interference” which requires more attention: e.g. by providing resources which differ in structural organization
* Reducing the frequency of feedback (e.g. by providing aggregate feedback every N trials or by reducing the frequency of feedback over time)
	* My brief skim indicates this works mostly for motor tasks, where you can become too reliant on the feedback and use that to guide what you do, rather than your own proprioception etc.

Q. Why does effective mental training often require effort?
A. Because increasing difficulty often increases training effectiveness.

Q. What counter-intuitive effect does increased difficulty have on performance in training tasks?
A. It typically harms performance during training but improves it in long-term measures.

Q. Why might learners believe that introducing difficulties into practice sessions makes them learn less well?
A. Added difficulties will often harm performance during practice (while increasing long-term performance).

Q. Why might coaches be institutionally disincentivized from adding desirable difficulties to practice activities?
A. They might be evaluated by students’ short-term performance.
