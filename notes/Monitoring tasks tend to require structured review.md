# Monitoring tasks tend to require structured review
And structured review is rarely motivating. However, they're great for catching problems before they become errors – and great for decreasing the sense of growing uncertainty you get when you're not on top of things.

Examples of this are:
* [[§My personal finances]]
* [[§My implementation of project-duration awareness]]
