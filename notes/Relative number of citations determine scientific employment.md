# Relative number of citations determine scientific employment
Number of citations in itself doesn't matter much, it's the number of citations relative to time in the field, typical citations for a researcher in the field and, to a lesser extent, number of papers that matters.

Eg.

§§ RC = \frac{Citations}{(a · t + b · n_{typical citations} + c · n_{papers})} §§

This means that [[Field size determines number of citations]] is probably irrelevant, as long as the field is not so tiny as to not attract any funding. See also [[Ability to attract funding determines scientific employment]].

What, then, determines one's relative number of citations?
1. [[Value of work determines number of citations]]
2. [[Number of papers determines number of citations]]
3. [[Distribution of work determines number of citations]]

These are determined by [[§Scientific Productivity]].
