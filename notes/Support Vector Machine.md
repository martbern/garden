Which type of machine learning model does this illustration represent?
A. A support vector machine

Q. How might we allow SVM to be used on data that is not separable by a hyperplane?
A. Transform the original space into higher dimensions

Q. What is a kernel for SVM?
A. A mapping function to higher dimensions allowing SVM to satisfy 1) Dealing with non-linearity and 2) Remaining computationally efficient.



Q. What might the point be of transforming:
