# Shape the strategy
First you want to [[Set the appetite]].   This defines how many and which types of seeds to grow. Some ideas are non-viable from the get-go, simply because you know they will take too much time or too much energy. 

Then, it's time to start mocking up rough solutions, but continue to [[Work at the right level of abstraction]]. Remember to [[Balance searching for and making your own solutions]].

Then you want to reduce uncertainty., [[Probe the approach]].

* [[Quality check at low value]]
	* This is part of [[Shape the strategy]] and related to [[Perform cheap experiments]]. 
* [[Probe the approach]]
	* After you [[Shape the strategy]], you're typically enamoured with what you've thought up. If this is about improving something (rather than having fun, which is valid!), it's time to be skeptical. You want to [[Quality check at low value]], and now is the time.
* [[§Problem solving]]
	* [[Shape the strategy]]
	* Q. If you had to split problem-solving into 5 stages, what might those be?
	
* [[Shape the research strategy]]
	* After you [[Define the research problem]], it’s time to figure out how to solve it. This borrows heavily from [[Shape the strategy]].
* [[Shape up]]
	* This is analogues to [[Define the problem]] and [[Shape the strategy]]. See if it doesn’t fit in better there.
* [[Ideas present themselves before problems]]
	* Probably not really. It's just an interesting phenomenon in how I [[Shape the strategy]] and [[Do the work]]. Insight is an input, but it's rarely the full solution – and I can get insight into problems that are not worth solving, ie. where when I [[Validate the appetite]], it doesn't fit.
