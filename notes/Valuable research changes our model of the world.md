# Valuable research changes our model of the world
To assess this:
* Ask co-authors whether they’d (or someone) would be surprised by XY result
	* Do they know of research in this area?
* Ask friends and family whether they’d be surprised by XY results
* [[Accurately assess the literature]]

## Backlinks
* [[Select the right problems]]
	* Selecting the right problem requires that we know what the right problems are. My hunch is that they satisfy [[Valuable research changes our model of the world]] and [[Valuable research uncovers levers for change]].
* [[§Write a research idea pitch]]
	* It needs to argue whether it can change our model of the world ([[Valuable research changes our model of the world]]) and whether it can uncover levers for change ([[Valuable research uncovers levers for change]]). 
* [[Betting table for research]]
	* [[Valuable research changes our model of the world]]
* [[§Improving career prospects as a scientist]]
	* [[Valuable research changes our model of the world]]
* [[Value of work determines number of citations]]
	* [[Valuable research changes our model of the world]] and [[Valuable research uncovers levers for change]].
	* [[Valuable research changes our model of the world]]
* [[Find work that compounds]]
	* How does this fit into a researcher life? (For entry: [[Valuable research changes our model of the world]])
