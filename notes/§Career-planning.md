# §Career-planning
See also "career-planning" in Taskheat.

In the long-term, I have multiple options that I can see, and which I find attractive:
* [[Research full-time]]
	* [[§Improving career prospects as a scientist]]
* [[Surgery]]
* [[Medical internist]]
* [[General practitioner]]
* [[Other]]

Right now, I believe that I'll want to do a PhD in something. But what that something is depends on {which specialty I want to go into ([[Weight of PhD depends on specialty]])}.

I'll get much more information on this as I start doing introductionary positions.

I'm not certain whether I want to do full-time research or be a medical doctor, but that is something I'll get more info on during intro-positions as well. Doing a PhD provides strong benefits for both, so its a good strategy, but delaying it a bit isn't a problem.

I can get more information about being a *full-time researcher* by talking to Bodil ([[Look for career-advice with Bodil]]), and part-time researcher by talking to Charlotte ([[Seek mentorships]], [[Look for career advice]]). That is definitely something I want to do, especially combined with finding out what I can do now to maximise my chances.

For now, gain as many general research skills as possible:
* Learn new methods ([[Cluster-analyse til HBSC-SCL]])
