# §What I value
> A great job, a loving partner, a home of your own: all these are goals. As you work toward them, connect with the values underlying them. Notice that you’re living by those values and appreciate the satisfaction this brings.

This is the product of [[§Clarify your values to know which actions to take]]. If there are values you're struggling with, check that page.

Globally, I have three things that I *strongly* value:
* [[Value curiosity]]
* [[Value caring]]
* [[§Nobility]]

But values are just as a dice. They have many sides, but not all can be seen at the same time. Which values are best expressed depends on the context, so:
* [[What I value in family]]
* [[What I value being in a romantic relationship]]
* [[What I value in friendships]]
* [[What I value in employment]]
* [[What I value in education and personal development]]
* [[What I value in recreation, fun and leisure]]
* [[What I value in community life]]
* [[What I value in environment and nature]]
* [[What I value in health]]
