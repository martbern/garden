# §My researcher work routine
My problem is that I have trouble prioritising between which actions to take as a researcher. There are many actions that all contribute to succes, but in different ways.

Given that I don't really know [[How much time is optimal for exploration]], I might as well optimise for well-being.

*Establish the criteria:*
* [[Curiosity]]
	* [[§Scientific Productivity]]
		* [[Minimise waste]]
			* [[Work primarily on value adding activities]]
			* [[Minimise non-value adding activities]]
		* [[Balance WIP]]
			* [[Decrease lag time]]
	* Learning
* [[Caring]]
	* Make room for helping others

*Compare alternatives*
/Unstructured, based on best alternative at any given moment/
Dramatically interferes with [[Minimise non-value adding activities]], as it increases ambiguity and processing of which thing to take action on quite a bit. It'll also tend to favour urgent tasks where others are waiting for me, rather than the tasks that, when I'm relaxed, I think have the highest impact ([[Work primarily on value adding activities]]).

Q. What are the disadvantages of prioritising tasks in the moment?
A. It increases ambiguity and tends to favour urgent, rather than important tasks.

/Semi-structured by category of work/
Ensures that I work on the important stuff, even though it isn't urgent. Allows daily curiosity. Could be better at minimising WIP.

/Run by TimeHero (urgency, then importance)/
Makes everything an obligation, since it's in the inbox. Disqualified.

/Structured by pre-defined schedule/
Same obligation problem.

*Develop and implement a plan of action*
Well-being is optimised when I do something interesting and something important every day, while living up to expectations of myself and those of others. This requires some degree of productivity.

I might as well semi-structure it in a minimal way that allows for all of this.

Morning
* Process notes, work on what you think is highest yield right now.
* Produce writing for articles.
* Work on articles

Lunch
* Execute misc. tasks that are required, eg. program.
* Learn something.
* Reflect on the day
* Actual task review for tomorrow

This is the minimum routine.

Q. What is my minimal routine as a researcher?
A. Initial note writing, text production, misc., learning, reflection – but it's only a guideline, adapt to what is right.

I've also added this to the work habitifier.

I want to be succesful, and I find most of the work I do to be important, so most days will stretch substantially beyond those guidelines.

How does research related to something I’m writing fit into this?
