# What does statistical independence mean?
I've understood it formally as:

§§ P(A) · P(B) = P(A ∩ B) \leftrightarrow P(B) = P(B|A) §§

### Frequentist vs. bayesian
But when doing an experiment, eg. estimating blood pressure (BP), measuring A gives us information about B.

If we know just a little bit about the distribution of BP (eg. normal distribution), measuring A gives us information about the mean of BP. B is most likely to be close to the mean. Then measuring A gives is information about B. Are they then truly independent?

In the frequentist view, yes. While measuring A gives us information about our estimate of the mean, the true mean is unchanged.

In the Bayesian view, no, probably not.
