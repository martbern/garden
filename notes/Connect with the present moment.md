# Connect with the present moment
There are multiple good arguments for this:

1. {[[Connect with the present moment to enjoy it fully]]}
2. {[[Connect with the present moment to be able to take action]]}
3. {[[Connect with the present moment to notice the consequences of your actions]]}
4. {[[Connect with the present moment to avoid struggling against it]]}

It's typically a problem for people with depression (who may be preoccupied with the past) or people with anxiety (who may be preoccupied with the future).

There are many techniques for this, most of them are about practising mindfulness. One new one I haven't heard of before is using the thinking mind: Narrate your experience objectively.

* [[§The Happiness Trap]]
	* Many times in our life, we're preoccupied by thoughts and this causes us to miss out on what's happening in the moment. [[Connect with the present moment]].  This is the solution if you're already doing all the things that matter to you, but are deeply unfulfilled.
