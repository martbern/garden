Some neural networks are useful for solving a variety of problems, some of which are simultaneously available. This results in the need for prioritization. Fatigue is experienced as a result of sub-networks evaluating the current prioritization as sub-optimal, ie:

1. A neural mechanism that evaluates the difference between the expected utility of the current task and the expected utility of alternative tasks (ie. the opportunity cost), resulting in
2. The qualia of boredom/task-fatigue, resulting in
3. Decreased task performance or task switching

Add in a time-dependent exploitation penalty (the longer you stick to the same task, the higher the perceived penalty) to ensure higher fitness in changing environments, and you have a decent model.

In the same vein, the homeostatic sleep mechanism can be thought of as an opportunity cost on a larger scale, balancing out of exploration the current environment with exploitation of the day's information.

Be aware of the term task-fatigue, it is distinctly different from sleepiness.
