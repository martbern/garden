# What is the causal mechanism for MHC
Many of the elements hypothesised to be part of a causal mechanism (stress, poor socioeconomic status, hyper-sensitisation to stimuli) are known from other diseases, so a useful question: [[Is MHC separate from known diseases]].

For causal mechanisms to be tested, the best epidemiological study design is the follow-up study, ideally with multiple exposure and outcome measurements. We only have one exposure measurement, so this strongly limits the kind of causal mechanisms we can test.

A parallel, [[What is the causal mechanism for NSS]].

	* For this to be true, it means that there is some part of the causal mechanism for MHC ([[What is the causal mechanism for MHC]]) that we believe that (1) we can adjust (2) in a way that makes the children have greater well-being.
