# §Make time for exploration
Much of what is important is not mandatory for progress; it isn't on the path of a well-defined objective.

For example, when we define the next stepping stone to work towards, we're doing something that's essential to even starting on the path. You can do it quickly and haphazardly, but that runs the risk of choosing poorly. In a "white-water world" with local optima (deception), taking time to generate and lightly explore many options is often time well spent.

This is especially true when selecting chunks of work where the purpose isn't completely fulfilled until completing the chunk (eg. writing a scientific article, fulfillment happens at publishing).

Exploratory actions are often open-ended and interest-driven, without obvious output. But they're still incredibly important. We can't conceive of the novel study unless we know the relevant questions ([[Work on the right problems]]), and we can't answer those questions unless we know the right methods ([[Use the right methods]]).

This leads to actionable advice; if you're working in a field where novelty and creativity are important, dedicate time to exploration.

My general considerations are that I don't want to use inboxes ([[Inboxes feel like obligations]]).

* [[How do I organise general reading in my work]]
	* This is a special case of [[§Make time for exploration]].
* [[Improve on skills, or produce better work]]
	* But there are also types of work that we can't conceive of unless we have the mental methods of the right methods. This ties into [[§Make time for exploration]].
