# Does it make sense to connect goals to activities?
Like in [[§My Implementation of Life Well Spent (LWS)]].

I think so! It can be generative in both directions – if I have a goal I don't know what to do about, that's a challenge.

And if I do activities that don't tie well into goals, well, what's the point then?
