# §Forgetting
* Forgetting improves inference
	* [[Forgetting removes noise from our models]]
	* [[§Forgetting helps compression of information]]
		* [[Forgetting prevents overfitting]]
	* [[Forgetting combats distribution shift]]
* Forgetting makes memory more efficient
	* [[Forgetting may be useful in increasing search speed]]
		* [[Size of set is inversely proportional to lookup speed]]
* There are different types of forgetting (Davis, Neuron 2017)
	* Interference induced forgetting
	* Motivated/intentional forgetting
	* Retrieval induced forgetting (retrieving one part of a memory suppresses others)

[[What does information in §Forgetting imply about memory]]

Does anything I've learned on forgetting imply stuff for Anki practice? Right now, I think I want to [[Use heuristics]], and I can support that by memorising models.
