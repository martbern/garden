# How do I keep next steps salient in knowledge work
Currently I switch to taskheat after some time just spinning my wheels. As an alternative, you can do a very short daily review of projects, eg. Reviewing the “actual” pane in Taskheat every day after doing work in notes. This helps [[Decrease distraction in thinking]]. For entrainment, I’ll add it to habitifier.

Scheduling it as daily is a [[JIC]] instead of [[JIT]], but running it as an experiment for now isn’t a bad idea.

I also want to [[Decrease dependencies]], and that happens best if I do a more thorough review periodically. I’ll add that to timehero.

Q. Why might we review running projects?
A. Keeps them salient and identifies upcoming problems.
