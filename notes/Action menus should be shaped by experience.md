# Action menus should be shaped by experience
For leisure, we can have a feedback loop like [[§My Implementation of Life Well Spent (LWS)]] since there are many actions that we can do repeatedly.

This is harder to do with more purposeful, goal-oriented activities. There, the most useful action depends on circumstance. To get feedback, you need a good model. You need broader categories of the work, e.g. "Programming for XYZ" to learn from the data.
