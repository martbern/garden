# How to get published
Standard-formulering for “tak for respons”. Se Sørens slides.

Insert the changes from the revised manuscript, eg. “Bra bra changed bl”. Decreases the risk that the reviewers will re-read your manuscripts and find new things.

If the reviewer points missing information out erroneously, just say “thank you, can now be found in XYZ”.

Maybe add “collaboration formation” to [[§My research production process]].

Don’t sweat the small stuff for writing – it’s going to get modified after submission often, and the small details may get changed.
