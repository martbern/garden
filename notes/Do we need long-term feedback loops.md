# Do we need long-term feedback loops
[[Building requires feedback]]. If we're poor at spontaneously learning from useful feedback, implementing explicit long-term feedback loops can be high yield.

The primary problem I experience is when I think there may be a pattern (eg. I spend too much time optimising things that don't matter), and I'm considering betting on another instance of that pattern. If this doubt means that there is learning to be had (which it typically does! Doubt indicates uncertainty, and if this uncertainty matters, the learning matters), I'd like to explicitly learn from this decision. 

I worry that I'll forget the doubt in the future, and the decision will just be incorporated into who I am – ie. that I don't update sufficiently on the new evidence, because there isn't a time where I'm made aware that it conflicted with my prediction. Ie. [[Hindsight bias]].

The super simple, trial basis is predict book or similar.



ideally by being reminded of it in the future.
