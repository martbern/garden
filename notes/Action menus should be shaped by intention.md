# Action menus should be shaped by intention
One way of making this happen for [[§My Implementation of Life Well Spent (LWS)]] is [[Exponential decay]], e.g. for the ratings to be weighted by time.

Another is to implement it as part of [[Weigh activities by "reflection factor"?]].

Another way of it to be implemented is to select a value/goal and then be presented with actions that are congruent with those. This separates itself from the current implementation of [[§My Implementation of Life Well Spent (LWS)]], in that it keeps intention as the primary factor. 

By having intention be primary, I add more friction ([[Choosing requires friction]]). This is both beneficial ([[Adding friction facilitates choice]] and costly ([[Choosing is effortful]]).
