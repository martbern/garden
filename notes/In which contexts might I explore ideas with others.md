# In which contexts might I explore ideas with others
Since I love exploring ideas, and I love having tight-knight social relationships, how can I merge the two?

This is because [[I value exploring ideas]].

* Good conversations! 
	* Often facilitated by a good dinner with people who are good conversationalists. ([[§Conversation]]).
	* Or at parties, with people who are interesting (e.g. Merete at Børglum)

* Or clubs, like old-school salons where you meet to talk about something, a pre-defined subject.
