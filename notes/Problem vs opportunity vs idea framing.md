# Problem vs opportunity vs idea framing 
This is essentially a [[Valence framing]] problem, whether to obtain something great or to avoid something bad.

What, then, separates an opportunity from a problem? All problems are opportunities, if there’s potentially a solution. For me, “that’s a problem” is so tightly coupled to “what can we do about it”, that separating them doesn’t matter. 

It’s also the case that I only think of something as a problem if it’s at least somewhat important. In that sense, sticking to “problem” terminology for internal use is probably fine. For external use, I want to use more positive framings, ie. potential for improvement.

It’s probably not an [[Approach vs. Avoidance goals]] problem, since the goal is either to “solve the problem” or “make use of the opportunity”.<
