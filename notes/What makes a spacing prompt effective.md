# What makes a spacing prompt effective
Probably depends on what you're trying to encode. [[Spaced repetition can be used for much more than memorising]], but how to "wear the groove" depends on what you're trying to do.

If, say, you're trying to affect behaviour change in a given situation, it's probably incredibly important to focus on imagining that situation vividly. If you're trying to memorise a fact, you want a clear question with appropriate generalisability.

To approach this, start with memory ([[What are the most important attributes of good spaced memory prompts]]) and then consider the general case ([[How do the principles for spaced repetition memory differ from other spaced practice]]).

Specific examples for different operations:
* [[How to do spaced repetition for categorisation]]
* [[How to do spaced repetition for prompted thought]]
* [[How to do spaced repetition for analysis]]
