# Integrate your values
What we want to avoid is choosing the values that we believe will please others.

Instead, a technique can be [[The magic wand]], or use words other than values, such as "being yourself, being true to yourself, living the life you want, personal qualities you want to model for others".

* [[§Clarify your values to know which actions to take]]
	* If you run into challenges,
[[It is unreasonable to expect others to change]]
* [[Commitment increases risk of regret]]
	* There's higher risk fo regret, if the commitment starts to de-integrate from your motivations ([[Integrate your values]]). And, in general, we're more excited by new ideas than old promises.
