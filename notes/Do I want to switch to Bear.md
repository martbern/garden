# Do I want to switch to Bear
# Bear vs Obsidian
A possible improvement on [[§My note system]].
What is the core motivation?
* The tremendous speed, both on desktop and on iOS
* The ability to open a note in a separate window, allowing free organisation of the interface
	* ==However, Obsidian auto-organises windows, making the flow of adding new files easier==
	* ==Obsidian has better auto-complete when linking to new files==
* The decrease in customisability makes me less likely to mess around with it
* It’s an excuse to add back-links contextually for the file

But there are some definite issues:
[[Do I want to use Bear ID instead of my own UUID solution?]]

**Solved:**
* How do I keep work/life separate
	* You can scope with tags. If you have a given tag open, new files start with that same tag
	* This would get rid of a lot of the possible sync conflicts, which is definitely ideal
* Edit times do sync
* Andy’s backlink solution works
