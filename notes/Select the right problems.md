# Select the right problems
Selecting the right problem requires that we know what the right problems are. My hunch is that they satisfy [[Valuable research changes our model of the world]] and [[Valuable research uncovers levers for change]].

To estimate whether they change our model of the world, we need to [[Accurately assess the literature]].

Already at this stage, it makes sense to [[Quality check at low value]], [[Prototyping for research ideas]].

* [[Define the problem]]
	* Do I think that this process can improve on [[Novelty search]] for finding interesting research problems? [[Discover interesting problems]], [[Select the right problems]].
* [[Betting table for research]]
	* The purpose is to [[Select the right problems]]. This is best done by incorporating the best available information, which happens best with collaborators. It is also easier if there are multiple problems to choose from, so the question isn’t “is this opportunity good enough”, it’s “which opportunity do we want to work on next”.
* [[Work on the right problems]]
	* This means that we need to [[Discover interesting problems]], [[Select the right problems]] and [[Stick with the right problems]].
* [[Define the research problem]]
	* The purpose of this step is to [[Select the right problems]]. This means that you want to:
* [[Probe the research problem]]
	* First of all, you want to figure out whether this problem has already been solved ([[Select the right problems]]) .
