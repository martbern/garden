# Attention is zero-sum
Since [[Attention capacity cannot be expanded]], the fact that [[Attention is zero-sum]] means that it's incredibly important to [[Protect attention]] and to do [[§Prioritisation]] well.

This means to expend attention where it *matters*, and to minimise attention where it doesn't ([[Govern attention]]). A huge part of why we pay money to have chores taken care of is not only to save time, but largely to [[Protect attention]] ([[Spend money to protect attention]]).
