How might we do that?

One part is [[Leechblock]], especially if combined with [[§LaneSwitcher]].

* [[Govern attention]]
	* This is split into [[Protect attention]] and [[Direct attention]].
* [[Attention is zero-sum]]
	* Since [[Attention capacity cannot be expanded]], the fact that [[Attention is zero-sum]] means that it's incredibly important to [[Protect attention]] and to do [[§Prioritisation]] well.
	* This means to expend attention where it *matters*, and to minimise attention where it doesn't ([[Govern attention]]). A huge part of why we pay money to have chores taken care of is not only to save time, but largely to [[Protect attention]] ([[Spend money to protect attention]]).
* [[Attention is limited]]
	* This means that we want to [[Protect attention]]. 
* [[Purpose should be salient when emotions are dysfunctional]]
	* Having purposes be salient all the time is probably not the ideal – we want to [[Protect attention]], and that means that purposes are to be salient when that is useful.
* [[§Attention]]
	* [[Protect attention]]
* [[Spend time well]]
	* Given that we have enough attention left ([[Protect attention]], [[Spend attention well]]). 
* [[Curiosity is only bounded by competing motivations]]
	* In that sense, the only way we need to protect against novelty is to avoid a "crowding-out" effect of [[§Shallow novelty]] on other, more valuable activities. We need to [[Protect attention]], so we can [[Spend attention well]] and [[Spend time well]].
* [[Limit inflow of information]]
	* To [[Protect attention]]. How might I do this?
