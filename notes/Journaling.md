# Why Journal?

I've been unable to find convincing studies on journaling. As such, I should only journal if I have intrinsic motivation for it; not because I expect benefits.

So, why do I want to journal?

1. To reflect on my day-to day
2. To keep an archive of what I've done and what I've learnt
3. To revisit memories and keep them fresh
4. To have a narrative of my life, to weave it all together into a meaningful story

What're the most effective ways of doing these things?

## Reflecting on Daily Events
A daily journalling session is probably the most effective way of doing this

## Archive
Journaling is a decent way of doing this, but photos and small videos are probably more effective. If I want to do this well, I need a better phone camera and a faster phone to encourage snapping more pictures. However, is this really, truly important? See if it keeps popping up.

## To revisit memories
The best way of doing this is by adding memories I want to remember to Anki.

## To create a life narrative
This probably makes the most sense to do periodically, instead of daily.

### Projects this makes me want to do

1. A very short daily journalling routine focused on reflecting on lessons from day-to-day
2. An easy routine for storing photos – eg. pruning Google photos once a month, so that it reflects what I've done this month.
3. Adding memories that I want to keep revisiting to Anki once a month
4. Making sure that my long-term reviews don't just look ahead, but also look at what I've accomplished in the last period. What's happened, and how I need to process it.
