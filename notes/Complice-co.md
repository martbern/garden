# Complice.co
Does great at:
* [[Most important work first]]
* [[Use goals to select actions]]
* [[Align emotions and cognitions]]

Complice is about aligning my values with my goals with my actions. It's the high level overview, and it can be used quite well for choosing what to get done. It is the cornerstone.

## Backlinks
* [[§Goals]]
	* [[Complice.co]]
* [[Prioritisation should be guided by goals]]
	* One of the ways to [[Use heuristics for prioritisation]], and one of the things [[Complice.co]] does incredibly well.
* [[Do I want as intense hedonism as possible]]
	* Since [[MIL is fun]] and I have decent mechanisms for adjusting overrun ([[Complice.co]], [[Beeminder]]), does this imply to make those as enjoyable as possible as well? Eg. [[Do I want to play FPS games]]? 
* [[§My execution system]]
	* Right now it's a combination of [[Complice.co]], [[Sunsama]] and [[§TimeHero]].
	* I’ll definitely want to use [[Complice.co]]. Of important features it is lacking:
	* [[Intention as context]] - [[Complice.co]]/[[Sunsama]]
* [[§My optional execution system]]
	* Most of this is, right now, in [[Complice.co]].&lt;
* [[I want mastery in my recreation]]
	* I think, in total, it's something I'll add to [[Complice.co]], but as one of the less important goals. This helps me with [[§My optional execution system]], and specifically helps add mastery as something to do during vacations.
* [[§My execution system for recreation]]
	* [[Keep task meaning salient]] - [[Complice.co]]
	* [[Intention as context]] - [[Complice.co]]
	* [[Be intentional about where you allocate your bandwidth]] - [[Complice.co]]
	* [[Never forget calendar events]] - [[Complice.co]] with a reminder during planning

	* [[Most important work first]] - [[Complice.co]]/[[Sunsama]]
	* [[Rough scheduling increases perceived autonomy]] - [[Complice.co]]/[[Sunsama]]

* [[Systems should encourage your values]]
	* Do I want to add nature to [[Complice.co]]?
