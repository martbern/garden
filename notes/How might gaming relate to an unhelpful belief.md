# How might gaming relate to an unhelpful belief
I might believe that to rest properly, I need to do what I feel desire for. Oftentimes, that is gaming.

1. Is it true? 
No, but it's a subtle. To recuperate, we need to have our needs fulfilled, and one of those needs is [[§Intrinsic motivation]]. However, what we desire and what fulfills us can be disjoined ([[Sometimes you desire to do something, without wanting to want to do it]]). 

That is definitely the case of gaming, which is strongly habituating ([[Habitual and intentional behaviour are different]]). It does have good sides, however, so ta total "ban" is not a good idea ([[§Gaming upsides]]). 

However, gaming alone is probably a poor time investment; I can have a deeper, more satifying fun by looking for something creative, or reading a book.

Basically, I don't have to undertake *the* thing I *most* desire in a given moment.

Rather, I want to do activities that are intrinsically motivated – but if I can find activities for which I have intrinsic motivation *and* that have some possibility of being useful (through the proxies of being difficult for others and being about creating something), those activities are likely going to lead to a better life.

2. How do I act when I believe this to be true?

I act in a somewhat escapist manner; I play more computer games, I spend less time with my girlfriend and/or being creative, and I feel more drained afterwards.

3. Who would I be without this belief?

I would be someone who's dedicated to doing good work, but who takes care of himself in his free time (through exercise and other activities the refuel [[Neutral hours]]) and has fun while doing it!)

Q. What is an argument for exploring alternatives to gaming?
A. If I can find activities for which I have intrinsic motivation *and* that have some possibility of being useful (through the proxies of being difficult for others and being about creating something), those activities are likely going to lead to a better life.

* [[§Intrinsic motivation]]
	* [[Make room for intrinsic motivation]]
	* [[Intrinsically motivated creation is a good heuristic for a life well lived]]



* What are the alternatives?
