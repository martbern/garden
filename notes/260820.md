Being a parent will bring with it adventures, but of a much different kind. It'll allow me to be curious, but much less curious intellectually than if I live a childless life.

That only holds if I know what I want to be curious about, though.

Committing myself completely to the goals that I believe will most satisfy me right now, with a time-cap (5 years) is
a great trial! It can test whether the life I imagine parenthood could ruin is a life that suits me. It'd also reality test whether that life is available, or only available in my imagination.

I have some vague sense that the future will be great, but not much of an idea of how that future will look. I also have some vague sense that parenthood will ruin that future.

However, if finding my future is somewhat like [[Novelty search]], and [[Parenthood is hard]], [[Parenthood blocks exploration]] and therefore many potential futures.

But any decision blocks many potential futures! The point of a decision is to make one future real, but that requires letting go of many potential futures.
