# What does MHC consist of
When we say “what does it consist of”, what we really mean is what do these symptoms capture. Do they capture somatic and psychiatric disease (and/or their severity), do they capture functional somatic disorders, or do they capture general ill-being.

If it captures severity, we’d expect that two children with the same diseases but different MHC would have different healthcare outcomes. This doesn’t separate it much from the FSS hypothesis or general ill-being, though.

But if children without diagnoses have different healthcare seeking patterns, and that is associated with MHC, then it makes sense!       

We can attempt to answer this via:
* [[Is MHC separate from known diseases]]
* [[Which diagnoses do children with MHC receive]]
* [[Which groupings exist within MHC]]
