# Do I want to promote notes that haven't been developed yet
Some part of me doubts whether this is a good idea. I want to promote somewhat developed ideas because they're concepts of some size, but do I want to promote the random idea that I had a couple of years ago but never got around to developing?

It depends on the signal to noise ratio. If the random old ideas are just as likely to spark something new, I want to invent them. If not, I don't.

Using my intrinsic interest as a gauge is probably not a bad idea; so an undeveloped idea should almost never be promoted. Maybe I should try this out – essentially changing my two categories into something like seeds and saplings.

Another thing is to not promote notes if they have less than n characters of content.
