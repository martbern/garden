# Make room for your feelings when they become unhelpful
[[Emotions are unstable]], but since [[We largely control how we respond to emotions]], we have tremendous freedom! This allows us to avoid [[Thoughts about emotions can cause problems]].

[[Expansion]] is the practice of being mindfully aware of emotions while avoiding [[Struggling with emotions spawns more struggle]].

> 1. Observe the strongest sensation associated with the feeling
> 2. Breathe into it
> 3. Allow it to come and go

It's a practise of non-reactivity. Just like [[Cognitive defusion]] requires that we focus on our thoughts to practise it, so does [[Expansion]]. But we're working towards needing it less and less, to let the emotions be and go do something meaningful.

Another interesting note is that [[Most sensations are neutral]], but [[Interpretation of sensations affects emotions]].

This clashes with [[Society believes that emotions control our behavior]].

Basically the same arguments as [[Defuse from your thoughts when they become unhelpful]].
