# §Increasing motivational intensity
This is about how to increase [[Motivational Intensity]], and can be expanded upon by adding the notes from there. 

Here I’ll list a bunch of suggestions and do research. However, I also want something that’s easy to implement, like a recipe.

For waking up to feel good, we need to have actions in the day that are either pleasurable or connected to something meaningful for us. 

One way of doing that is to set goals; they help keep us focused ([[Choose goals wisely]]).

I want these to be more salient and attractive than merely a text-presentation. One way of achieving that might be to use [[Craft.do]].
