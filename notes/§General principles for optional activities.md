# §General principles for optional activities
Optional activities are typically fun and at least partially initiated by [[§Intrinsic motivation]]. This means that we want to do as many of them as feasible.

For that to happen, they must remain salient ([[Motivation is increased by salience]]) without feeling like obligations ([[Inboxes feel like obligations]] [[Salience of utility strangles fun]]).

It is not essential that we make *the best* decision, but we want to make systems that encourage easily making good decisions quickly ([[Use heuristics for prioritisation]], [[§Speed is more important than sequence for productivity]]). Intuition + salient options seems a good choice here.

We also want a system that allows us to algorithmically [[§Guide exploration]]. Most things are a lot more fun if you get good at them, and [[Building requires repeated effort]]. But intuition needs to be fed ([[Building requires feedback]]), and it needs to have salient options ([[Motivation is increased by salience]], [[Keep your values salient]]).

One implementation of this is the [[§Self-recommendations]].

Q. How can you support the intrinsic motivation of optional activities?
A. Keep them salient (novelty), embrace their challenge, and avoid instrumentality and obligations.
