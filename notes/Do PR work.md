# Do PR work
Providing value as a scientist is different regarding whether you're trying to provide value to the institution (citations/publications/PR), or providing value to society as a whole (doing science that solves problems).

These strategies (luckily) often overlap, though. When disseminating your research (citations/PR), you increase its impact. Making many publications means doing more work, and if that work is net positive, more publications is equal to more impact.

Finding these overlaps is where the largest leverage is, since [[Integrated motivation improves quality of work]].
