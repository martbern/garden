# Decrease dependencies
When you’re planning a project, you want to add only the dependencies that are necessary. Dependencies mean that some tasks will have to wait – and waiting increases lag time.

However, adding dependencies can increase efficiency a lot; eg. getting feedback early, making you avoid dead ends.

Q. What are the consequences of adding dependencies to a project?
A. It can increase efficiency, buy makes resources more likeky to wait, and makes failure propagate to more of the project.

Q. Why do we add dependencies to a project plan?
A. It can be truly necessary, or it can increase efficiency.
