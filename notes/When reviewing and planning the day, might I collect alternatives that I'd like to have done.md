# When reviewing and planning the day, might I collect alternatives that I'd like to have done
Serving the same function as regret, learning from mistakes (both of choosing the wrong things, and letting the wrong things sit).

This seems like a decent idea, if I can make it easily operational. I want to make regrets salient if they mean that I can act better in the future.

E.g:
+ Notes are rolled up by age in the "weekly" review, so I can reflect on them and take action if appropriate
+ If I come up with an activity I'd like to have done, I turn them into future possibilities for activities

However, psychologically it might make me look more negatively at the world. 

One way is 'How might you have made this day even better'?, which I have implemented.
