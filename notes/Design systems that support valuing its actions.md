# Design systems that support valuing its actions
Since [[Motivational intensity is determined by perceived value of the goal]].

Roughly, this means systems that:

* Connect you with your passion (what you find fun/intrinsically motivating)
* That protect [[§Intrinsic motivation]], 
* That reward successes (you can set that up yourself)
* That create fun competition, something game-like
* Connect you with meaning, eg. Your major life goals
* Allow you to find flow (match skill with difficulty)

Might there be more on this in [[The Motivation Hacker]]? And how might we implement this in daily life?
