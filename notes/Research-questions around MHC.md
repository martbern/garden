# Research-questions around MHC
Can the questionnaire be grouped in a more predictive way than MHC?

* [[What is the causal mechanism for MHC]]?
* [[Are children with MHC in need of more interventions]]?
* [[Is MHC a useful conceptualisation]]?
* [[What does MHC consist of]]?
* [[Are the diagnoses children with MHC receive appropriate]]?
* [[How do we separate the different MHC hypotheses?]]
