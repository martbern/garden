# Are children with MHC in need of more interventions
For this to be true, it means that there is some part of the causal mechanism for MHC ([[What is the causal mechanism for MHC]]) that we believe that (1) we can adjust (2) in a way that makes the children have greater well-being.

This is probably true, but it is true because MHC most likely captures general areas of ill-being ([[Is MHC separate from known diseases]]), making the interventions likely to be helpful even for children without MHC. The real question is whether there is some area where it is true for children with MHC in particular.

This is more likely if MHC is a separate construct ([[Is MHC separate from known diseases]]). If not, it is the treatment of the known diseases, rather than MHC, that we should focus on – or a re-categorisation.
