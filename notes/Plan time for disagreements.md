# Plan time for disagreements
A very clever and effective way of dealing with the inevitability of friction points and sync difficulty in a relationship is to schedule 1–1 meetings in advance. At least once a month, have some time with the *explicit* purpose of discussing what is difficult and bothering you. 

This can help you in multiple ways:
1. It gets things off your chest without having to come at an “inconvenient” time
2. It makes it easier to compartmentalise, so you don’t have to be quietly fuming the rest of the time

It’s also a great excuse for a good beer and a long walk with your spouse.

Furthermore, it keeps you close to them. Showing the most vulnerable parts of yourself is what intimacy is all about ([[Vulnerability is required for caring]]); others can’t show that they care about you if they don’t know what you care about.

To make use of [[Principles are most useful if they are bounded]]: [[When does it make sense to confront problems?]]
