Se "The Iron Law of social intervention" fra Gwern.

Broadening interventions for high-risk groups to the entire population is not cost-effective.

What do we mean by "primordial interventions"?

Since evidence tends to be created where it's easiest to demonstrate benefit, it is likely that systemic benefits are being under-examined, ie. that there are relatively low-hanging fruit.

Why is this the case? Lack of government funding due to cost/risk, and a desire to implement right after pilot studies.

The classical, rational pathway is often ignored when introducing interventions – eg. General Health Checks.

This applies especially outside healthcare. We have to make decisions without "sufficient" evidence.

Why can't we do RCTs on eg. a soft drink levy?

Intervention studies should only focus on critical uncertainties
This makes sense, if we are very certain about the causal network. If not, we'll draw the wrong inferences.

Criteria for natural experiments:
1. The allocation must be able to be treated as if it were random (ie. not confounded)
2. Be relevant for the current context (typically doesn't induce artificial effects)
3. Plausible causal inference

Bradford Hill's criteria

Major issues:
1. Exposure definition
2. Selection bias
3. Valid basis for the counterfactual
	1. Dosis-response or
	2. Relevant control group
4. Proper confounder adjustment

How good is good enough? (Good enough for what?)

> It is neither inferior nor merely the best available when all else fails.
Why not?

> On the contrary, it is often the only way to generate meaningful evidence to address critical questions about investing in popula- tion health interventions.
Yes, but that's only because all else has failed (ie. is not feasible). Take example of force-feeding.

Why might we want to delay implementation of policy, even in the face of relatively convincing evidence?
Policy is extremely hard to revert, eg. general health checks. The cost of making a mistake is huge.
