# ACT has allowed me to look forward to normal things again
I think it's decreasing [[Experiential avoidance]] as a global phenomenon, allowing ordinary things to get me excited – eg. Game hos Mads or Tenet (Chris Nolan) with dad.

Whatever the mechanism, I'm intensely grateful for it.

Ironically, this looking forward to things can become part of the happiness trap since [[Chasing positive affect leads to suffering]] and [[Avoiding negative affect leads to suffering]], so the biggest gain is probably taking effective action towards the life I want, eg. not getting up late, not missing work days etc.
