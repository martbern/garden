# Exploration is about learning
Not in the sense of memorising facts and teaching yourself skills, but in the sense of {treading novel ground}. This means doing things that provide [[§Deep Novelty]].

It also means that [[Exploration is more efficient with memory]], because you can learn faster if you don’t have to relearn things.
