# Align emotions and cognitions
An [[§ACT]] view would be to notice emotions and, if they’re not aligned with who you want to be, make space for them and then take the action you believe to be right anyway. [[Choosing is everything]], and making these choices is what makes us human.

But [[Choosing is fallible]], especially when it conflicts with emotions. Since [[Emotions are volatile]] and aren’t always reliable indicators of truth, when we listen to our emotions in the moment, we run the risk of making choices that we regret. 

Furthermore, [[Most activities are poorly designed for motivational intensity]], so many (modern) activities can be important without having emotional alignment. 

If we can get better alignment between emotions and cognitions, we perform better and enjoy life more. 

## Implications
This means that we want to:
* [[Design systems that align emotions with cognitions]]
	* [[§Incremental thinking]]
	* [[§My Implementation of Life Well Spent (LWS)]]
* [[Put yourself in social contexts that support your values]]

while using the [[§ACT]] method whenever our emotions are poorly aligned.

Q. Why might emotions not be aligned with cognitions?
A. 1) [[Emotions are volatile]], 2) [[Most activities are poorly designed for motivational intensity]], 3) [[§Compulsion]], 4) You haven't allowed yourself to reflect or 5) cognitions you don’t believe

Q. Why might systems be required to align emotions with cognitions?
A. [[Most activities are poorly designed for motivational intensity]]

	* How, then, do we facilitate it? We want cognitive choices and emotional alignment ([[Align emotions and cognitions]]).

* [[Self-regulation doesn’t require cognitive control]]
	* Eg. we can make decisions beforehand that shape the environment, helping us [[Align emotions and cognitions]]. 
* [[§Emotions]]
	* This means that [[Emotions are important if they're helpful]]. Furthermore, emotions aren't who we are. They're only intuitions. This means we shouldn't fight them, but listen to and think about them, so that we can [[Align emotions and cognitions]] ([[Deliberate to validate emotions]]). 
* [[Resistance arises when we don’t find actions valuable]]
	* OIT predicts resistance, but it doesn't explain all of it. We may often feel resistance towards something important – eg. if it’s difficulty, [[Difficulty can be both good and bad]], or if it’s poorly structured for [[Motivational Intensity]], [[Align emotions and cognitions]]).
* [[Optimise for the long run]]
	* What does this imply for [[§My execution system]]? Probably that I don’t want to maximise time spent at all. Rather, I want to keep it steady around a given level, and to change it up and down depending on how I feel. I want to [[Align emotions and cognitions]], and use that to adjust time spent.
* [[Align §Wanting, §Liking and §Approving]]
	* Probably large overlap with [[Align emotions and cognitions]], and largely that [[Emotions are emergent heuristics about actions for values]], [[Emotions are intuition that something is important]].
* [[Feeling is necessary]]
	* I’m mostly interested in it at the emotional level, because that might imply that it is even more important to [[Align emotions and cognitions]]. 
* [[Purposeful activities don't need to be pleasant]]
	* If possible, [[Align emotions and cognitions]], but sometimes it isn't. And oftentimes, we do errors of affective forecasting, so we overestimate the affective loss of doing the work.
