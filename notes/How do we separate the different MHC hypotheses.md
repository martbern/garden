# How do we separate the different MHC hypotheses?
Eg. that it’s:
* [[Reported NSS may be a marker for well-understood disease]]

* [[Reported NSS may be a marker of propensity for symptom perception]]

* [[Reported NSS may be a marker for perceived seriousness of symptoms]]

But probably not:
* [[Reported NSS are probably not a marker of illness-behaviour]], but NSS most likely affect illness behaviour

We can examine this among children that have no prior chronic diseases and which don’t end up with a diagnosis during follow-up, but only if we have an outcome that isn’t dependent on the above – eg. [[Pitch: Are NSS associated with Z- or R-diagnoses]]. This doesn’t exclude that there is a disease process that we don’t understand yet, or that NSS are due to diagnoses we know but that just aren’t treated.

* Each symptom is a marker of specific disease, this is examined through [[Which diagnoses are the different NSS symptoms associated with?]] and [[Look at which diagnoses they get, and which symptoms are most predictive, to approach an understanding of them]]
