# Why do we do reviews
I feel a lot of resistance towards them, so there needs to be a strong argument to continue them.

## Exploration
1. Improve activities/actions that are worth improving
	- [[How do I know which activities to improve on in LWS]]
	* To learn from successes, so we can make them happen more often
	* To learn from failures, so we can avoid them in the future

## Resource allocation
Basically, what I want to know is whether I'm spending my *time, energy and money* well. That means that I want to:

1. Spend it on the right activities, e.g. in places where I believe the marginal value is high:
	1. Spend less where the value is low
	2. Spend more where the value is high
	* [[What makes time well spent]]
	- [[How do I estimate the marginal value of an Nh in LWS]]
	- [[How do I estimate the marginal value of an hour for an activity in LWS]]
	- [[How do I estimate the marginal value of a dollar for an activity in LWS]]
2. To figure out if we're resource-constrained in some dimension
	1. Time
	2. Energy
		1. [[Do I want to visualise Nh earned by workouts etc. weekly, to see if I'm burning or investing energy]]
	3. Money

## Cleanup and maintenance
1. To catch problems before they grow. E.g. catch an upcoming deadline or similar.

Q. Why might weekly reviews be time efficient?
A. It can eliminate activities that aren’t important
