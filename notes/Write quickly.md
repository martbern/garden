# Write quickly
To write quickly, we need a good outline ([[Outline well]]) and fast typing ([[Learn touch typing]]).

Since the amount of days spent doing the writing is often important, we want to make it pleasant to write. We'll then write more hours pr. day, improving the productivity measured in calendar time. This is the main argument for learning to accurately touch type ([[Learn to touch type]]). While it's a tremendous amount of work to get down cold, I believe the comfort will be much higher.

It does take having a period of time to consistently put in a meaningful amount of practice without falling back into old patterns, but I think it'll be worth it.

Especially since I've remapped the WASD keys to moving the cursor around, there's going to be a steep learning curve for me. Is it worth it? Possibly. Is it the highest yield work I can do right now? Probably not.
