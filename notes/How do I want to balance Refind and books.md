# How do I want to balance Refind and books?
[[§My reading system]]

Ideally, I want to learn as much useful and interesting information in as little time as possible. 

Many of the general arguments rely on books being higher quality. However:
* [[Level of editing depends more on quality, not medium]]
* [[Level of research depends on quality, not medium]]
* [[Insight density depends on quality, not medium]]

Arguments for books:
* [[Books are helpful for tall knowledge graphs]]
	* [[Books can give you an overview of a field]]

Arguments for articles:
* [[Articles allow broader exploration]]
	* [[Articles feel less like commitment]]
* [[Articles are more error-prone]]
	* [[Articles are more likely to overfit]]

And some that I am unsure about:
* [[Unsure: It’s easier to filter books by quality]]
* [[Unsure: Books may contain knowledge with a longer shelf-life]]
