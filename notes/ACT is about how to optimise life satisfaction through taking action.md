This contrasts it with the more Buddhistic flavor of mindfulness I've been practicing so far, which has primarily been about letting go of expectations and practicing non-attachment. This contrasts highly with [[Cognitive fusion is not the enemy]].

ACT is not about being continuously avoiding fusion with your values (although [[Don't hold any thoughts too tightly]]), it's about most effectively aligning your behavior with your values.
