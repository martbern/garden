This has strong implication for how I'm spending my time. Currently, I'm exploring whatever I find interesting. This is incredibly freeing and fun! But it runs the risk of me running out of interesting work; something that I'll be paid for and that can [[Signal competence]] when looking for more work.

It also runs the risk of not completing anything truly worthwhile, something meaningful to you. You want to do something that matters, and you have the opportunity to do so in the next 5 months.

Currently there are multiple factors that guide your exploration: you have a set of co-authors, and those co-authors have specific fields they work in.

If you want to {produce even more} in the coming months, guide your exploration to {the fields of your co-authors}. Explore the open questions, be curious about the "established facts", and see if you can't contribute something.

This will also help you to nourish generalisable research skills ([[§Scientific Productivity]]). If you discover interesting problems or methods, devote time to those as well.

How, then, do we determine the best balance ([[Improve on skills, or produce better work]]).

Not only will this work be helpful in itself, it'll also signal to future employers that you're the kind of person that does valuable research. Of course it'll be a stronger artificat if you'll continue to work in the same field, but it'll be a strong artifact in doing research, no matter the field.
