# DECIDE
*[[Define the problem]]*. Taking a step back to ensure you really understand the problem at hand should be the first priority when trying to make a decision.

*Establish the criteria*. If you’re about to purchase a piece of software, what are the criteria? Is it price, great support, ease of use? List all the factors you want to consider before making a decision.

*Consider the alternatives*. Try to spend the right amount of time on this step. Too much time spent considering all the alternatives can drive to overthinking and analysis paralysis. Just make sure you have done enough research to have a few solid alternatives.

*Identify the best alternative*. Weight the list of criteria you have created in the second step, and rate each of the alternatives. Then, compute the result to see which alternative makes most sense based on your criteria.

*Develop and implement a plan of action*. Time to act on that decision. Especially if you have a maximising thinking style, it’s important to force yourself to not go back to the previous steps and to move forward with the decision.

*Evaluate the solution*. In order to make better decisions over time, examine the outcomes and the feedback you get.
