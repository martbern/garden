# Make status quo minimal effort
Life is unpredictable, so as a heuristic, make status quo minimal effort. This means that if you were to go back to just maintaining (eg. after experiencing burnout) we want that to be as low cost as possible.

This isn't always desirable – we want the upsides of [[§On Commitment]]. But be aware that committing has costs, and commit when it is indicated.

One example of this is [[Systems should be self-cleaning]], or its weaker sibling, [[Prioritisation should be minimal effort]].
