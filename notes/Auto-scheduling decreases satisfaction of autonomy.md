# Auto-scheduling decreases satisfaction of autonomy
By removing choice, auto-scheduling decreases autonomy.

Phenomenologically, it seems there are important caveats to this.

Firstly, some autonomy can be re-introduced by the auto-scheduler not imposing a specific time, eg. [[Rough scheduling increases perceived autonomy]].

Secondly, since [[Auto-scheduling makes limitations obvious]], it moves the decisions up one level of abstraction. Rather than deciding exactly which task to do right now, you have to decide your priorities; which projects matter most to me right now, given my constraints? However, this doesn't mean that it is actually perceived as satisfying autonomy, though. (For more, see CET).

* [[Auto-scheduling makes limitations obvious]]
	* This is incredibly useful! It makes it obvious that you should either take on fewer things, or increase bandwidth for a given project. Beware that there are more considerations though, like [[Auto-scheduling decreases satisfaction of autonomy]].
* [[Auto-scheduling limits analysis paralysis]]
	* The problem, though, is that [[Auto-scheduling decreases satisfaction of autonomy]].
* [[§Auto-schedulers]]
	* [[Scheduling makes activities seem more like work]], probably through [[Auto-scheduling decreases satisfaction of autonomy]]. Can be somewhat circumvented by [[Rough scheduling increases perceived autonomy]]. Rough scheduling (eg. at a day or rough section of day level) implies that I can decide not to do something or in which order to pursue activites.
