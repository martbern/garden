# Are MHC in need of more interventions
<!-- #work/research-idea Among children with MHC, is the association between number of hospital contacts and type of diagnoses different than among children without MHC? -->

This can lend information on multiple questions,
Separate into sub-types of contacts.
This may identify which diagnoses are the hardest to make – but does it really need the MHC?

The hypothesis is that children with many non-specific complaints have longer diagnostic workups and don't end up with a diagnosis. If MHC reflects FSS-like symptoms, we'll see that the children  in the upper quartile have

Ie. what the different diagnosis-patterns for quartiles of contacts are (especially ER)?

<!-- #work/research-idea This means that the children with severe impairment should relatively rapidly show up in hospital, have more hospital contacts, get a diagnosis if appropriate, and then have an appropriate amount of hospital contacts for that diagnosis. -->

[[Is the MHC flow in hospital generally appropriate]]

The children with low impairment should have a low amount of hospital contacts, and quickly fade out. Is this the case?
