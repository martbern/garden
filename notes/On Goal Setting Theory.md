# On Goal Setting Theory
More on this in "New Developments in Goal Setting and Task Performance".

Goals are divided into 3 categories: performance, behaviour and learning.

[[Choose goals wisely]] and [[Re-evaluate for each milestone]]. [[Set proximal goals in support of distal goals]].

Goal-setting has a plethora of advantages, mainly that [[Goal setting increases performance]]. This happens immediately by [[Goal setting increases focus]] and [[Goal setting increases effort]]. It also increases the probability of goal-completion via two mechanims. (1) Proximal goals provide rapid feedback which can make you more skilled by [[Goals prompt strategy improvement]]. (2) Since goal-setting makes us more invested in goal-attainment, [[Goals increase persistence]]. Surprisingly, [[Goals can increase creativity]].

Goal-setting can backfire if you're in a novel environment for a couple of reasons. The newfound focus means that [[Goal setting decreases flexibility]], so you may neglect areas that turn out to be important. Furthermore, if the path to the distal goal is unclear, goal-setting can result in deception.

[[Novelty search with constraints is probably the best option if we're facing objectives with deception]]

Goal setting can also backfire by resulting in other areas being neglected. The research shows that goal setting is essentially about directing focus ([[Goal setting increases focus]], [[Goal setting increases effort]]).

[[Goal ambition determines performance]]

Some elements are only helpful, if they lead to goal-setting and commitment:
[[Feedback can increase performance]]
[[Incentives can increase performance]]

Under some circumstances, goal-setting isn't helpful:
[[Complex tasks benefit little from goal-setting]]

##### Open questions
[[Do stretch goals fit into my life]] 

---
Q. Which content types can goals have?
A. (Performance or outcome), (behaviour or process) and learning goals

Q. What is the main advantage of goal-setting?
A. It increases performance

Q. How does goal-setting increase immediate performance?
A. By increasing focus (ie. removing competing actions) and by increasing effort.

Q. How can goal-setting increase performance growth?
A. Proximal goals can lead to faster feedback, and [[Building requires feedback]].

Q. In which environments is goal-setting especially likely to backfire?
A. Changing environments where high flexibility is required (set short term goals), or if the path to the goal is unclear.
