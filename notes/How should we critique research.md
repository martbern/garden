# How should we critique research
https://www.gwern.net/Research-criticism

Almost all research can be critiqued, the important thing is which critiques matter.

Pragmatically, [[Results matter if they change decisions]], so [[Criticisms matter if they change results]].

It isn't always possible to know whether a result will change a decision (much research is essentially [[Novelty search]]), but it does qualify which criticisms matter.

[[Statistics are important]]

[[Statistics can be dangerous]]
