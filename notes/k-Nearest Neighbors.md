# k-Nearest Neighbors
Keeps training data in memory. For new data, finds the k nearest neighbours and returns the majority label (for classification) or the average label (for regression).

Popular distance measures include:
* Euclidean distance (som i almindelige rum)
* Cosine distance, using vector angles as distance (+1 if same direction, 0 if orthogonal, -1 if opposite)
* Chebychev, Mahalanobis and Hamming distance.
