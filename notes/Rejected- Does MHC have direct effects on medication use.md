# Rejected: Does MHC have direct effects on medication use
One explanation is that MHC captures specific symptoms of well-understood diagnoses. This would mean that MHC in itself is not a phenomenon worth studying in the hospital context, since it is merely a proxy for things we already understand (ie. that the direct effect of MHC->Medication = 0). Stated differently, MHC doesn't have incremental validity.

Another explanation is that MHC is the result of general process, but that MHC captures "residual" problems that aren't captured by the current diagnostic system.

Under the naive assumption that diagnoses capture the entire effect of disease on medication use – ::which they definitely don’t, since diagnoses are only from hospital, not in GP::.

This implies that if we know which somatic and psychiatric diagnoses the child has and gets, and MHC are still predictive of medication use, then MHC  captures more information about the base process than the diagnoses themselves and/or it has additional base causes.

Prescribed medication is, in this respect, special, because we expect it to only be prescribed if a diagnosis is made, and diagnoses to be made only if some cause is known. A direct effect of MHC on number of prescriptions means that MHC is, in itself, a risk factor – that it either increases the amount of prescriptions one diagnosis results in, or it results in prescriptions in itself.

Challenges:
A direct effect of MHC -> Medication can be residual-effects from incomplete conditioning on diagnoses.
