Dramatically interferes with [[Minimise non-value adding activities]], as it increases ambiguity and processing of which thing to take action on quite a bit. It'll also tend to favour urgent tasks where others are waiting for me, rather than the tasks that, when I'm relaxed, I think have the highest impact ([[Work primarily on value adding activities]]).
