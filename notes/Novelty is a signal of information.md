# Novelty is a signal of information
[[Information]] is a signal that changes your model of how the world works to be more accurate.

In our ancestral environment, something seems novel if it's different from what you expected, ie. if it changes your model of how the world works. Since we sampled the world ourselves, our sample was typically unbiased.

However, in the present world much of the novelty we encounter is highly biased [[Artificial novelty]], or it is novelty that doesn't relate to reality at all.
