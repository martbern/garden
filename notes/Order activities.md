# Order activities
This also ties into how I can separate the ideation and research phases of my day; ideation typically takes more focus, but easily turns into research if I'm looking stuff up.

Researching can easily be done at any time of my day. It doesn't require holding a ton of information in my head, it requires that I know what question I'm trying to figure out and how to reference information on that topic.

Reading is the next step after that; I separate it from research in that it’s reading the same source continuously. For most material, this can be done even when I’m somewhat distracted.

And lastly, experience. This is more fun the more energy I have, but in daily life I’ll do my best to defer it to the end. During weekends and vacations, I want to fit it in wherever makes the most sense.

My best implementation of this so far is the [[§Self-recommendations]].

Q. Why do you want to order types of activities in your day?
A. They require different levels of focus.
