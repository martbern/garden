# We have limited control over what we think
> Here’s a little experiment. As you keep reading this paragraph, try not to think about ice cream. Don’t think about the colour or the texture or the taste of it. Don’t think about how it tastes on a hot summer’s day. Don’t think about how good it feels as it melts inside your mouth. Don’t think about how you have to keep licking around the edges to stop it from dripping on your fingers.

It's not that we can't think positively for a short run, or ignore a thought for some time – we do have some control over what we think and feel ([[We have limited control over what we feel]]).

But if the thing is important, we're not going to be able to ignore it for long. It is only limited control.

Some examples of how we tend to do it are here, [[Thought and feeling control strategies]].

	* While we can control the outer world relatively well (/fix the roof if the water is dripping on you, work more hours to get better pay, [[We largely control what we do]]/), [[We have limited control over what we think]] and [[We have limited control over what we feel]]. The extent to which you believe this can be scored with the [[Control of Thoughts and Feelings Questionnaire]].
