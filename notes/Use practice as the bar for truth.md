# Use practice as the bar for truth
Things can be true without being obvious in practice (statins), and they can seem true in practice without being true (eg. homeopathy). Using practice as the bar for truth is not fool-proof, and it can be overturned by stronger types of evidence. [[Filter feedback]].

But action is a cheap way of testing an idea, and it provides tremendously rich feedback. It can uncover a ton of small things we didn’t consider during analysis:
* The evidence we had doesn’t generalise
	* It has edge cases
	* It doesn’t fit with this population
	* Etc.
* We misunderstood the evidence
	* Poor internal validity

How, then, do we apply this? Well, use [[Believe-ability]] to [[Filter feedback]]. And take action on much of what you learn. Not only does it give you feedback, also [[Action makes knowledge useful]]. 

Q. What is something you learned recently, but that you haven’t applied?
A. .

Q. Why might we [[§Guide exploration]] to those things we can soon apply?
A. [[Use practice as the bar for truth]], and [[Action makes knowledge useful]].
