# Value effort efficiency
# Maximise effort efficiency
While [[Choosing is everything]], [[Choosing is fallible]]. [[§Determination]] comes from making a choice, but it doesn't last forever, so [[Building requires repeated effort]] ([[§Effort]]). 

That means that you want to decrease effort in a project when possible, but apply it every time it’s necessary. If you can make a task less effortful while getting the same results, that’s brilliant!

One way of achieving that is to make decisions at a system level, and have that system support our automatic behaviour over time ([[Design systems that value effortlessness]]).

Systems, then, need to adapt to our changing circumstances and goals. This is possible via feedback ([[§Feedback]], [[§Systems Thinking]]]]).

Furthermore, the emotional quality reflects [[MIL balances stimulation and relaxation]] – we want periods of effortlessness to be able to live ideal lives. Luckily, using complice doesn't result in permanent determination.
