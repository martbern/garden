## Backlinks
* [[§Gaming]]
	* I want to maintain gaming because [[Gaming can allow shared experiences]]; they are a good reason for me to keep seeing Simon and Mads, two people I care tremendously about. They're also just plain fun! ([[§Gaming upsides]]). 
* [[Select games to avoid problematic use]]
	* [[Games are not created equal]], so this means selecting the games with the most [[§Gaming upsides]] and the fewest [[§Gaming downsides]]. 
* [[Does gaming induce anhedonia for me?]]
	* This is speculation, definitely, but it’s a workable model. There are [[§Gaming upsides]], though, so it’s about how to get the good while avoiding the bad ([[§Gaming]]).
* [[How might gaming relate to an unhelpful belief]]
	* That is definitely the case of gaming, which is strongly habituating ([[Habitual and intentional behaviour are different]]). It does have good sides, however, so ta total "ban" is not a good idea ([[§Gaming upsides]]).
