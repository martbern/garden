# Subordinate non-bottlenecks
When non-bottlenecks have excess capacity, they shouldn’t overproduce. Instead, they should help bottlenecks out as much as they can. How does this look?

* Avoid overproduction, [[Limit WIP]]
* Implement sprint capacity upstream, to ensure the bottleneck never empties

	* Ie. is there a higher level of abstraction we can work on, while not inducing too much overhead for co-authors? Given the sparcity of time I can get with all co-authors, they're most likely going to be bottlenecks. To [[Subordinate non-bottlenecks]], it makes sense for me to do more processing before showing it to them. This does collid with [[Minimise waste]], specifically [[Minimise overproduction]] and [[Minimise overprocessing]].
