# The personal mnemonic medium programs attention
[[Programmable attention]] is the idea that we can decide through our systems where our [[§Attention]] goes. What we pay attention to is what we perceive, and what we perceive is what our life consists of.

The [[§The Personal Mnemonic Medium (general concept)]] is a great way of implementing that. It allows you to [[Do your own thinking]], and when you reach tentative conclusions, to easily entrain those into action ([[Action makes knowledge useful]]).
