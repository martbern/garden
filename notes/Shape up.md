# Shape up

This is analogues to [[Define the problem]] and [[Shape the strategy]]. See if it doesn’t fit in better there.

[[Work at the right level of abstraction]]. This also makes it easier to meet a deadline; if the scope is set in stone, you can’t re-scope it.

When work is shaped, it has three important properties:
1. It’s rough, so that there’s flexibility to do what matters
2. It’s solved, ie. there aren’t major open questions or rabbit holes
3. It’s bounded, so you know where to stop to keep it within your appetite.

When shaping work, you want to gradually make it more and more specific. Eg. “Purpose -> Analysis -> Table”. This makes it easier to implement the work, *and* it allows you to determine which things are outside the scope of the article.

* [[Validate the appetite]]
	* This is practically [[Fixed time, variable scope]] from [[Shape up]].
