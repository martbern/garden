# Some games foster compulsion
By "compulsion" I mean habit-forming above and beyond what is beneficial to the user. It feels extrinsic to who you are, because your base brain has been trained, but your higher motivations aren't aligned with the behaviour. 

One model of why this [[Fast positive but delayed negative feedback fosters compulsion]].
