# How do I organise optional activites in my work
The purpose is to keep the momentum interest-driven.

Using the same system as I use for reading in my personal life is probably not bad! It keeps the opportunities salient, without feeling imposing – I want to keep Pocket adds separate though, maybe using tags?

Sometimes, skills practice or general reading are going to be promoted by being truly important, ie. something I'll work on as soon as I have the time. This makes it tempting to add them to the to-do list, but I'm not sure that's the right approach. I want to do them when the time is right and within context.

This leaves room for some intermediate stage.
